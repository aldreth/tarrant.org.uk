With O2 walked to + from the loo around 6am. Felt I'd turned a corner. Then smack back. Had to get there pretty quick around 8-9 and had terrible breathing episode. E wheeled me back eventually. Tried again around 11:30 + had to call for M. Disappointed - poor all day. E took all fossil hunting near Brid. M came and made me coffee. I could hear the hoover and I think she's done a touch of cleaning Jools came with Freddie - 10lbs now and very bonny. I held him quite a lot, it was very nice. Lovely chatting to Jools - my day is much nicer if somebody bobs in. E back about 5 - they'd had a good time except for Rose getting her fingers trapped in the boot. Long chat with Mandy and Dave.

Had hoped for a return to the improvement I felt on Wed this morning, but it was not to be. E took the children out shopping for school things this morning and then he and the boys to badminton. Judy came this afternoon with large bag of magazines. J + R busy with their rooms, Toby too. Judy helped out with the hoover for R. As Judy left Jo popped in with news of her camping at Bishopthorpe and teh offer they have put on a house. Amazingly felt quite tired must have fallen asleep about 10:30.

Woke about 5:30 still feeling the same - so disappointing. E helps me wash and I get dressed to sit in the chair. I keep slipping down the bed and have started getting niggly aches and pains from being in bed - can do without that! E takes J + R down Bishy for shopping - Toby off to play squash with Andy - includes some coaching, not bad for Â£2. He also had a piano lesson yesterday. So he's all set up. E to the uni with John + Rose for Einstein Day. I chat to Anne O'Hanlon on the phone - she's really into sailing with her family. Speak also to Phil + Michelle - she's coming tomorrow. Looking forward to E's curry.

E went off to Meeting with John and Rose. Toby put his car back together. Dressed and sat in my chair. Experiencing some pain. I took some pain killers which make me feel very lightheaded. Michelle came with Betty's cake and lovely juice. E makes us tea and we sit and chat. Start to feel very nauseous. Jo bobs in and I have to send her away to be sick. Just as E brings up nice roast lamb! J + R enjoy swimming. T goes off over to Luke's. Fall asleep v. quickly - exhausted with a rather erratic breathing day.

Woke quite late this morning - didn't even hear Toby go out. Thought I'd taken the morning slowly, but had a nasty breathing episode after having a wee. Took me quite a time to recover, I felt exhausted. Edward into town with John + Rose. Toby still doing bits on his truck and over to Andy's in the afternoon. After E cycles to L + M's to return computer box and picks up O2 prescription, he returns and carries me downstairs and takes me for a walk. Absolutely fantastic to get outside. Warm and a light breeze on my face. Glistening river water, people out enjoying themselves. Lovely. Sat at the table for tea and then outside in the yard for coffee. Great afternoon.
