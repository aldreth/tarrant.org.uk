The previous entry was the last Cindy wrote in her diary. A while after Cindy died I made very brief notes of what happened during this week.

Toby back to school Edward and John to supermarket. Claire + Beth round in afternoon to chat and show some craft things. ~~C upstairs all day.~~ No, I think she came down after C & B went. I carried her down, which she found uncomfortable. Went for a walk along the river again.
