Scan this morning. Then a bit of retail therapy. Home for lunch then off for our big treat. Fabulous room in the loft. Dark furniture, large french bed and a pool table. Delicious big bath. Settle in the lounge with Tio Pepe, olives and very hot fire for an hour of so. Leisurely bath trying out smellies before supper. E has a bloody mary in the bar + we are served scampi soup + mussels as a taster for things to come. Order mushrooms, spinach + quail egg on a crostini for starter + woodcock for main. E a pheasant risotto + steak on rocket. Croze Hermitage 2001 to drink. Too full for pud - shame. Coffee + chocs + access to some cheese in the loft - which was magical and plush. Lovely, lovely day.

No rush this morning. Enjoyed tea in bed and a lovely bath. Fantastic waking-up in this lovely room, forgot where I was for a second. Fabulous breakfast around the enormous round table. Have bought goodies in the deli before heading home across country. Have had a fantastic surprise and lovely for E and I to be completely alone together.

Italian - good fun. Yoga - slept through most of it.

E in school this morning. John has diarrhoea and looks grim. Toby too and looked even worse, still did his paper round + went off to school. Very stoic and driven boy. Kept John home. Popped into town when E cam home and bought fabric for John's fancy dress. Spent best part of the evening on it. Parents eve for J+R and look through their work - all in good order. J's mental maths very good. Rose's writing coming on nicely.

Finished off J's coat - looked good. Made him a hat - no wonder people buy these things. Took ages, but I enjoyed it.

Met L+M for lunch at Meltons on the the Resident's first deal. Very nice, but not a very inspiring menu. Nice to eat with L+M. L treated us - sweetie! Hour sit down at home before going to the thread painting at the Guildhall. Basically knew it - must get down to designing something + planning how to realise it.
#####################

Returned to Guildhall this afternoon with J+R. T off to f/ball with Keith. J+I painted a section of the 'BIG PICTURE'. R too weary to enjoy it. Listened to Mary sing in Banks. Lazy afternoon/evening. E cooked tasty smoked haddock-spinach rissotto.
#####################

Lots of ministry in Meeting. Josh Parker - very full of despair - very sad. E took John to the cinema and Toby went along with Luke and Jordan. Rose to Mimi's. Quiet afternoon doing some Italian and finishing a cushion cover. Lance round for supper. Anita phoned to say Rose wanted to stay for a sleepover so will pick her up tomorrow. Feel particularly frustrated today at my lack of energy, would so like a good brisk walk, a swim, a run, anything really than endless sedentary activity. C'est la vie!
#####################
7
Start of the 1/2 term. Lovely to have the children home. A few things planned, but by and large hoping to relax and do our own things at home. Toby has done quite a lot of his truck driving. Rose bits of making. John writing, dancing and using the sewing machine.
#####################
8
Swimming with Edward for the children. J+R helped out with window cleaning. Toby seeing his mates. Last week at home for E before starting work - bit of an anxious time.
#####################
9
Rose + I to textiles with Nok. Working on the theme of sheep. Rose chose a winter landscape - the only one to do so. Good choice of fabrics + really getting the hang of stitching. Rose + I stay and continue work on sheep.

Play with Nok for Rose.
#####################
10
Second morning of textiles. Rose completed background stitching and stitching on the sheep - looks good.

Drive to Bridlington with L+M for walk along beach & fish & chips - very good, freshly cooked. Phoenix Dance with J+R. Excellent first piece, other 2 a bit too modern for J+R - great costumes. E to Oceans 12 with Toby.
#####################
11
E to optician this morning. Writing this retrospectively + can't think what we did - crafty bits and park, I think.
#####################
12
John read his Big Toe radio report - very exciting. Dance for Rose. E did shopping & Jean came round for coffee in the afternoon, also Jane who's here meeting wedding caterer. Viking battle in the afternoon - very cold. Mandy & Tom arrive about 4. Lovely to see them. Nice fish in tomato, olive sauce for tea, rhubarb fool - E's speciality, very nice.
#####################
13
E to meeting with John. Rose wanted to mooch at home. Toby + Tom on the computer. I got up late still feeling tired + slow with my cough. After soup + cheese lunch all go to Guild hall for Viking craft fair - E bought me a 'Lucet' to make braiding with, very aesthetic craft tool. I stay at home and sew. Nice chicken tea and some evening TV.
#####################
14
Nipped into hospital for blood test & then to Bishy Road for eye test - surprisingly no significant change, even though my short to long seems very slow. Nice lunch at new Italian with Mandy + Tom and a bit of shopping. Pick-up & then lovely sewing afternoon with Mimi, Rose & Eli. Edward seems to have had ok day at school - looks very drained. Tom for tea. All very busy.
#####################
15
Chemo 7 - bit of a disappointing scan; described as 'stable', but sounded 'worse' to me. However, do feel better & have been v. ill & bounced back plus treatments seem to really kick in near the end of the course. Will persevere & maintain faith. Lovely lunch at No 8 with Many & Tom - lovely to see Tom relaxed and chatty too. Bought crafty bits for Rose's wedding ring box. Busy eve @ Toby's GCSE choices presentation, Rose gym, John gym & E out for supper.
#####################
16
E at work this morning. Very busy morning shopping readiness for Tbi's arrival. Leave it for E to unpack as can feel myself running out of steam. Off to Italian with Mary leaving Swea to finish off cleaning - didn't make much impact on Rose's room. Cried off yoga and went to bed intended to get up to say hello to Tobi - didn't make it. Slept through to 4am + then had peppermint tea.
#####################
17
Greeted Tobi - seems very nice. Nice pottery gift from Germany + chocs for R+J. Coffee with E + then home. Did lots of baking - puds + cakes. Kath popped round for a cup of tea with tales of overexciting trip to Spain last week - 1st anniversary of Marcus's death. Tobi to bed feeling unwell. Has had no supper. We're all worried about him, but hoping it's just exhaustion + possibly feeling a bit overwhelmed. More exciting day for them tomorrow - going to Bradford Museum of Film & Photography.
#####################
18
Took T+T to see 'Million Dollar Baby' with Clint Eastwood. Deep + with a mercy killing at the end. Boys said they enjoyed it + Tobi said he could follow it. This film causing a storm among anti-euthanasia + evangelical Christians. I would want this if it happened to me.
#####################
19
Managing to get through fatigue + aches + pains quite well. E took T+T to the football with Keith this afternoon. John off to a party. 6 boys for tea + DVDs in the evening. E + I holed up in the back room. Met up with Joanne Smithells, Agnis Baskerville, Helen McDermott + Emma Thrussell in Bettys. Took J+R too. Lovely to see them + hear all their plans for next year. I really felt like I missed my job this afternoon.
#####################
20
Called off a trip to Whitby - Tobi didn't want to go to the beach. They went off at 10am and we didn't see them til 6. Moochy sort of day for uss - cold + wintery. Glad not to be driving over the moors.
#####################
21
Rose at home with a temperature. Spent the morning making Jane + Andy's ringbox. Nice to just have some time together. Went to see 'The Play What I Wrote' with Judy. Really excellent - very funny + brilliantly performed. E pranged the car in the ice. Wheel bent. He's ok. E bought FnC for T+T - German T loved them.
#####################
22
Farewell to Tobi - it seems to have gone very quickly. It has been very nice having him to stay. Scarcroft closed because of broken boiler. J+R had a good time in the snow then off to the park with Jo. Pumpkin soup for us all here. A lovely playday. - quite unexpected. Helen Barnes for a quick visit. She's as busy as ever - was looking really smart. Great to see her. Super Italian.
#####################
23
Dentist - Rose upset because she's to be seen by a specialist. Her bottom tooth is twisted. Nice supper with L+M.

Really struggling with the yoga. It's so late and I feel so drained. Can't bear the thought of giving up. E good day at school.
#####################
24
E home today. Car to Clive to finish off tyre repair. Had nice pizza lunch with L+M and admired their new kitchen. Off to Leeds for a Reiki - very good as usual. E not well - terrible sore throat.
#####################
25
Cooked solidly all day for the freezer. Toby back to bed + slept till lunch. E still not well + in bed too for most of the day. Can't remember the last time he had to take to his bed. E+I to see 'A Doll's House' @ the W. Yorkshire. Really excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed a night out - just us two. Sam looked after the children. Chatted a lot with Toby + did some making with Rose. Blue Peter annuals for John.
#####################
26
Departed pretty much as planned and good journey to M+D. Met up with Jayne + Steve, christopher + Matthew - both looking very grown up. Chris 2- today. Chatted over drinks in the bar & waited for Mum + Dad. Both were very surprised to see us all. Dad quite gobsmacked with his racing car voucher! Jayne had placed balloons on the table + once the heating was on it was a nice table. Food nice - my starter a bit mean. Back to M+D for coffees and fell into bed about 1am. A very successful evening.
#####################
27
Bfast with Mandy and Amy and then left about 10. Stopped for a coffee + then arrived back about 3pm. Mary out with R+J. Toby's football cancelled. Mary returned with the children + we had tea and a choice of 3 cakes no less! Started on clearing the kitchen. E did a bit of work. Dave on his way! It is 11:37 and the kitchen in pretty much clear - boxes taken over to L+M. TAble in the backroom along with day to day stuff. Everywhere starting to deteriorate into a mess - nowhere near as bad as it will be very soon I suspect.
#####################
28
It's very bad! Ceiling's down, gas cooker gone... everything gone in fact so no meal here tonight or for quite a few weeks. David + E worked well into the evening. Had the girls over for sewing - bird cushions looking lovely. Rose has finished hers. Sausage + mash at Granny's then picked up FnCs for the men. Dust is awful making me wheeze like an old boiler. Everybody coughing. Lunch with Helen Cadbury.
