E & I enjoyed a morning in town doing a spot of shopping and then went and had lunch together. It's been ages since we've had time alone.

Started the morning with an hour steaming and sitting in the jacuzzi at the Living Well centre - thank you Judy. L + M picked us up at 5pm for the W Yorks playhouse to see 'Lion, Witch + the Wardrobe'. Lovely tea and super production with great set + costumes. Everybody really enjoyed it.

Very windy morning, felt quite worried about Toby out on his paper-round this morning. Managed to walk Rose to dance, E. picked her up. Jean came bearing cream cake and allotment goodies. Always good to see her. Have arrange to go to the cinema on Thurs. Gentle afternooon saving energy for Debbie's party. Nice, but strange with no John & about 2 other women going through a divorce. What is going on?

E took all to Meeting and I had a very slow morning feeling tired and with back ache - no where near as aba as last time, however. John to gym and Toby to f/ball this afternoon. Rose backed some very nice coconut biscuits.

Rose upset this evening - wasn't sure why. I think because I was raggy.

E. to occupational health this morning so I took the children to school. Firt time in ages. Good start to the morning then sick about 1/2 hour before driving to Leeds for a Reiki. Thouth it was the chemo, but now know it's the tummy bug the children have had. Have spent all agernoon in bed feeling very fragile. T. revising hard for school tests. Had to cancel knitting with the girls.

Toby didn't want to ice biscuits with me at Meeting - no Luke or Jordan, so he went home. Ran the activity with 7 Fell Group however - great fun and they were all very good. Felt very worn out however. Wish I had more energy! Cooked Sunday lunch. Toby to Will Emerick's and Edward took John + Rose over to Lily's. Managed a sit down + a bit of knitting. Lance came for supper and we had an evening of TV goggleing altoghether except for Rose who was rather hooked on the Sims. Boys love watchin "Top Gear"!!

Zipped along for a bloodtest after dropping John + Rose off. Sleety + very cold - even Toby was wearing his coat. Very nice Reiki with Robert. Lots of contact over my aching tooth even though I hadn't told him about it. Edward fried left over jackets which we had with a glass of wine - yummy! Very busy with Rose, Mimi & Eleanor starting sewing projects. A blouse for ragdoll Jane + 2 bird cushions. Tea with Tom then pyramid making with John - very nice pyramid. John's stuck a goggly eye on the inside - great fun.

Italian revision + a bit of tidying before Swea came, then off to look at Snowhome sale. Saw nothing we wanted - except look plywood shelf I covet for the kitchen - bit expensive. Drinks in No 8 then I left E to drive back for a quick lunch before Italian. Very very weary. Bed by 6:40 after hot bath. Leaving E to hold the fort. Rose with Mary, Toby at football. John here.

Designer Outlet this morning - bought a nice skirt + some nuts!

Home for lunch and then lazy afternoon knitting. Josh Cole arrives ahead of Toby - he settles down for a cup of tea with J+R! Toby let out late, came in moaning terribly about the textiles. Poor woman, I can imagine Toby must be in with a right rum bunch of year 9's.

E + I put together a new recipe for beany burgers. Mimi + Eleanor come and learn how to use the sewing machine. Wonderful surprise as I get into bed, E has booked supper BnB and the Star Inn at Harome tomorrow. Very excited.
