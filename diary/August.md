Toby shopped with me at Sainsbury. Don't know how I would have managed without him - £150 worth! And he unpacked it all. E took J + R to the spy event at the Castle Museum and then to the Colour Fantastic in Rowntree Park - would have liked to have gone, but my energy failed me. Put together chilli + tacos with a fresh fruit salad for pud as Lance was coming for tea - all very nice. Lovely evening with E!

Finally got around to making a dressing gown for Laura doll with rose. Rose did most of the machining. She is very good now + can thread the machine without any help. She also - again without help - baked a brownie. Settled bills and made phone calls in readiness to depart tomorrow. E took T + J to play badminton and then to the park. A beautiful day. Had dreadful muscle spasms this evening - about 4 in sequence, very painful.

Drove to M + D, lunching on the way. Beautiful day and rather a shame to spend it in the car. Arrive about 5:30 and after supper spend time relaxing and catching up with each other. Sarah + Michael join us for supper with their little boy Adam sporting a new digital hearing aid (£2,000!) - v amazing. Hardly noticeable + had made a huge difference to him at school.

Mandy took us to Explosion a surprisingly interesting museum about guns and fire power at the old gunpowder factory on the Hard. J + R enjoyed themselves and we picnicked overlooking the harbour before going home. T stayed with Tom + played on the mini-motor. Out for an Italian with all to celebrate Jayne's birthday. V good, huge portions. Singing Italian waiter for Jayne.

Dad's Thruxton visit today. Lots of hanging around for J + R but the weather was kind. All had turned out to watch him speed round in a mazda, some MG model + a single seater. He really enjoyed himself and has had a DVD made, so will be interested to see this. All back to M + D for supper. T enjoys Tom's mini-motor again. Can see this being his next purchase. Had to get to bed - not feeling too good. E goes in Porsche.
#####################

Awoke feeling sick + was so before getting out of bed - just fluid. I think I must have been semi-conscious the whole journey interrupting my state only to retch in tissues. Dreadfully wretched and felt absolutely awful. (E thought, only for a split-second, that I had died!!) Managed to soak up the lovely sitting room for a while before retiring to bed. We have a lovely red room with most impressive Victorian style bedstead.
#####################

Felt better today, if rather weak. Found the beach at Harlech. Great expanse of golden sand bordering a beautiful blue sea. Dunes. Castle. Fantastic. Spent pretty much the whole day here. E had to carry me up the sandy slope and push me along the path. Still recovering from yesterday! Helped put together a large roast lamb dinner - excellent leg purchased by Lance. Good game of cards in the evening. J v sunburnt + uncomfortable.
#####################

Had to swap seats with Jack on the drive to the Snowdon railway because of car sickness - he was not impressed! Lovely scenery. Train fully booked so we satisfied ourselves with the Lakeland railway. Jack and Grace enjoyed themselves. Had a snooze on the return journey before Sarah + L took them to the stream. Walkers arrived back about 6. J +R hadn't walked so E had spent the day sitting by a lake - at least it wasn't raining! J + R camping out again.
#####################
9
The children, E and others made for the stream this morning. Beautifully hot and sunny. I found a sun spot around the side of the house overlooking the downward slope of the garden. E had taken photos so that I could get a sense of where they had been. Made sandwiches and then M + our family set off for Harlech beach. Another big party to Portmerion. Beach wonderful. All enjoyed T's dinghy, including M. Very nice BBQ by K +S for supper. A back to London, J spending night in tent. Cards with J, R, K, G + me.
#####################
10
More swimming in the stream for the children today - Katharine + Jane also. Rock climbing with Will in the morning using ropes. Despite initial hesitations J + R enjoyed it, E later told me. M, J + I had a lovely sit + chat in the garden in the morning. Beautiful sunshine and view down sloping lawn with generous borders and mature trees. J + E off to buy boots + rock climbing harness for the children in the afternoon! W + S a walk by themselves + the rest to the train. I enjoyed the solitude of the garden - sort of! So much would love a walk, a run, a swim, something active. Don't want to be too long like this. Cards with Jane, R, M, M + L. T, M + I watch the rest of Silent Witness. Sleep v badly.
#####################
11
Bit overcast today. E disappointed not to be walking with Will as planned. Go in staggered fashion to the Centre for Alternative Technology. A very gentle place and has the look of the rambling about it. Very impressive composting of various waste. J + R go with S + K + Tom to the farm at Harlech. We return home. J, R + T try out climbing harness up tree - great fun. Then off to stream for E, J + R. T assembles new aeroplane kit.
#####################
12
E + W off to Nantlle Ridge this morning. Cool and heavy dew outside unless has rained. K + S + T, S + children off to Harlech Castle. R decides she would like to go on the train. M drops us off with L at Porthmadog and we easily while away 1/2 hour before the train. Lovely, lovely journey with beautiful views. Sound of the train whistle, smell of the engine. All very evocative. Waiter service for snacks by very enthusiastic staff. M met at Ffestiniog. Home for lunch + then to the beach where we met up with K, S + T. V hot despite being overcast earlier in the day. Christine, the owner, brought her pony Bluebell round after tea for the children to walk and ride. Rose very taken with her. T retrieves his plane that he'd lost in the tree.
#####################
13
Very heavy rain for our departure. Me very breathless today. See a doctor in the afternoon to check for infection - as usual he didn't really know what to do. Enjoyed a pasta tea and actually felt hungry. T had had IKEA meatballs and a bacon butty on the way home with L - what a surprise! Lazy TV evening plus 'Chicago' on DVD.
#####################
14
Spent very late last night helping T with the finishing touches to his packing. E has driven him along with Josh to Leeds for a coach pick-up. J went with him. R beetling around on her own and I have been defeated by the effort it took me to get a shower. E taking J + R to see Charlie + the Chocolate Factory. Not sure I'm going to make it out of bed today - feel terribly incapacitated. L coming later to take us all to La Piazza - something for me to work up to.
#####################
15
Managed to get up at a reasonable time and have done a few bits + pieces around the house. Remain very breathy and cannot do anything that requires effort. J off for his first scuba diving class. Really enjoyed it. R to Southlands church for crafts. Refilled the water butt and enjoyed sitting in the yard listening to the fountain. Raised bed is fantastic. Red geraniums + deep crimson potentillas. Grasses flourishing. Chat with Jo - she's off to Rosedale for a couple of days. Catch up with Audrey - cat behaved herself for her. Supper at Mark & Michelle's! Very nice sparkling wine. A meal with an Italian flavour, Green + Black ice cream and very good coffee. Really nice. Excellent evening and the children enjoyed themselves. Beautiful evening + lovely moon to walk home to.
#####################
16
Appointment with Dr B this morning. L collected J to take him to his scuba diving + R dropped off at the craft activities. I was feeling very nauseous + just managed to sit through consultation - was sick outside thankfully. Straight to bed on getting home and an afternoon of complete oblivion. Felt as bad as I have in a long time, couldn't even drink anything and my O2 levels felt very rock bottom. Didn't want to be left on my own for too long. Sat up until about 3am and then drifted off to sleep.
#####################
17
Compared to yesterday felt much better. Managed to shower + be up for Gordon's visit at 10:30. He brought me flowers + cakes and sweetest sincere wishes. He's off to Oslo tomorrow. Collected R from the church. J + R then off to the Uni to pick up some old computer bits with E. I do some shopping, very very slowly, in the fruit shop. Happy to cook tea, water the garden and snip a few dead heads away. J + R now have a working, if slow, computer for around £6!
#####################
18
Awake with a pulled muscle in my left side that hurts when I cough. So, move around gingerly all morning. Jo brings R back and then E takes her + Anna off to Harrogate for Miss Yeowart's wedding. J stays with me + beetles around - tidies his room. M phones + says there's lots of blackberries on the allotment. Cycle him down there - it was a huge effort because of my muscle. He cycles home himself. Sick again later in the evening which leaves me feeling wretched.
#####################
19
Mandy's 40 birthday today - send her a text. She is coming later and I'm really hoping I'll be able to join in celebrations. Have spoken to Kate Hodge (MacMillan nurse) + she's going to get Dr S to come and see me so that we can get on top of the sickness. Mandy + Dave, Tom + Amy arrive. Mandy still in the dark about birthday treat. D says he was taking her to a campsite. Book into the Marriot in time for all to enjoy leisure suite. E + I have fabulous room with balcony overlooking the racecourse. I think this is on account of the wheelchair. Lovely meal in the evening. Good food, wine and excellent service. A wonderful treat from Dave for us all and I think a memorable b/day for Mandy.
#####################
20
Quite a difficult morning getting up, I think because of the having to get up and be down for breakfast. None the less a glorious sunny view across the racecourse. Fabulous choice for breakfast, I plumped for smoked salmon, trout, roll and fresh fruit salad. Dave took full advantage! Pre-dinner sparkling wine + crostini in the garden. Dave has bought Mandy a lovely ring - same place we bought her bangle. Then a lovely evening at La Piazza. Fantastic watching Mandy's face as the Happy Birthday serenade went up + she suddenly realised it was for her! A lovely evening with all the children there - they really enjoy going there.
#####################
21
David and Edward take all to the park and Mandy + I sit in the yard. It is a glorious sunny morning almost too hot to sit outside. Give Mandy my favourite brooch and we have a little weep. Laugh about things past and tell each other how much we mean to each other. Just too emotional really but afterwards we both felt that a tension had cleared. So much having a good time together + determined to enjoy the time and yet knowing what it was really all about. Wave goodbye to them mid afternoon. I watch A Room with a View. T goes off to play tennis with Bill, John to Tom's and E and R cycle over to the woods near Jean. Enjoy a bread + bits supper. Sleep well.
#####################
22
It is very difficult to get up. Any effort now seems enormous. James, Emma and crew arrive around lunchtime. Manage to get up about 3pm and E pushes me down to the park. Return and have tea with L + M who have brought wine + plant for our anniversary. T makes a very good meatball supper. I sleep again between tea and supper so in balance have spent the best part of the day in bed! Children all getting on really well. R sounds very in control in bathing Hannah and J washes her hair.
#####################
23
All have gone to Hunmanby today. It is the first outing I've not made. Feel like I've been in bed forever already! Mick and Joolz phone and will visit next week. Have got back on course with my knitting, written to Annette, played loads of patience, looked at photos and listened to the radio... now what? Think I'll try and muster the energy for a bath.

Mary came round and made me coffee and roll. We sat in the yard and had a bit of a weep. All came back weather beaten and E made a very nice fish pie for tea.
#####################
24
All went to the Castle Museum this morning. Lots of heavy rain. E + R came back early as R had had enough. Helen, David + Sam came for lunch. They're on their way back to London. Did lunch very much in two sittings. James and Emma decide to go after tea, so the men take the children off to the wood and Emma + I put together a chilli. Lovely having them to stay and the children all got on really well. Very nice to have space back too and catch our breath before the next guests arrive!
#####################
25
Slow + slouchy day for E + the children after so much business. J + R watch Harry Potter - again! T goes to Monks Cross with Josh and Tom. Get E to push me in the park later in the afternoon - need to get outside. Meet Jo with Anna + Adam and J + R decide to go back with them. E + I have coffee opposite the Castle Museum. Go to L + M on the electric bike to have supper with Üla and Lilian. We have a very nice supper and it was nice to meet up with them again. T cycles back with me.

Start Tarceva.
#####################
26
Writing retrospectively and cannot think beyond a late morning again... Chris Hughes came about 11am and I managed to get dressed reasonably quickly. She had brought me a tarte au citron - really nice although I could only manage a little. Ted and Lily came to pick her up and Lily stayed for the afternoon + for tea. E does tacos, everybody's favourite. Manage to drive Lily home - it is an effort.
#####################
27
Ask T to take me out to the Gallery. He pushes me along the river. E, J + R go by bike. T enjoys the nice polished floors for pushing me on - he can get up a bit of speed. Nice exhibition on the Forest. After a drink in the cafe he takes me home. It is so nice to get outside and good to spend some time with T. Phil + Marcia arrive and E cooks a very good noodle supper. I manage to chop a few veg.
#####################
28
Phil, E, R + Claudia set off to do the breadcrumb trail and J, Lucas and Marcia to the Railway Museum. Manage to bathe and get up in time for lunch with Marcia. E + co return much later having lunched out and picked up cakes at Betty's. T very disappointed not to be sailing with the Holmans. Too much wind. I retire after tea and cake. Don't have the strength or appetite for tea.
#####################
29
All go into town to walk around the walls. T goes to Tom's some time during the morning. E phones me from La Piazza. Phil comes up before they set off to say 'goodbye' - bit emotional. Enjoy some soup and then later an omelette and a small glass of very good wine from E's box from the Wine Society. Decide to make a big effort and get up. Glad I do. E pushes me along the river. J+ R on rollerblades. Return home to phone call from Brian. He cuts my hair. Can't think why I didn't do it earlier.
#####################
30
Needed the bathroom really early. Huge effort. Breathing starting to hurt now. Got E to push me back from the loo. I keep taking the tablets.

E takes them all to Waterworld. Chat to Judy on the phone. She will come later this week. E returns and takes R off to Boyes to buy a present for Sarah. Mick and Susheila arrive for coffee - made by T. The come and sit upstairs with me. Had hoped to get downstairs, but I'm worried I'll not get back up again. Enjoyed shepherds pie - samosa too spicy - shame! Big cuddle from R.
#####################
31
Despite spending all day in bed I slept solidly. Woke up and felt very spaced out and strange. Couldn't get to bathroom - resort to bucket - oh the shame! Doze all morning on and off. Children out to party (Rose) and L + M for the day. E makes me some nice butternut squash soup - I manage a little. Then I determine to get up. E pushes me along the hall and with quivering knees I get downstairs. E walks me along the river - absolutely fantastic to be outside. Beautiful day. Bump into children, L + M at Capaldis. Sit in yard. Am a little sick after tea. Manage to sit down for supper. Don't know what has happened, but I feel enormously better compared to yesterday.
