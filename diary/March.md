D doing lots of wiring. E shovelling ceiling rubbish + driving to the tip most of the day. Me - bit of shopping on bishy + then looking after food needs - tidying a bit. Toby's parents eve - DT teacher strongly advise (off the record) against manufacturing. Upset Toby making him do some German with me. I thought it was a good idea! See if he'll help me with my Italian.

Definitely need Toby to help me with my Italian - I think it could be really helpful if he did 10 mins with me twice a week. Shopped for Dave. Mary took the children to school, my breathing has been very laboured today, everything is very exhausting and the wheezing is tedious. Frustration in all I do today. Rose has made a lovely 'Smile' booklet - great fun. J+R great help with washing up & T with the ceiling. E exhausted.

Lots of driving around today to shop for Dave. Then lots in the evening for gym club and feeding the boys over at Mary's. E+D worked till lateish & then went over to eat + shower. Still feeling very wheezy - really hoping for some sort of recovery from this apparent deterioration.

More shopping for Dave first thing. Then into town to buy pressie for Amy. Went for a fairy, came back with lovely hand blown glass baubles.I hope she likes them.

Very low about my lack of breath. Felt back to where I was a couple of weeks back before treatment - could walk very short distance only. Can't believe - still - it's come to this. Lovely good work assembly for Rose - Goblin poem was fun. Bought new dance shoes for Rose. Nice mooch on our bed with Rose reading before buying Indian takeaway. D+E very worn out Dave has worked like a slave all week - has done amazing things this week.

Still felt intoxicated in Meeting! Moved into the Mount and celebrated with roast dinner. Great to have some veggies. Nice to have some room, access to washing machine etc etc. Lovely home made cards from all the children for Mothers day. Phoned my mum for same plus Amy to wish her happy 18th. Sent lovely glass balls as pressie.

Massive sorting out at house to get ready for damp-proof on Wed. Ele + Mimi here for hand embroidery, Tom round for tea. This house is lovely, but exhausting, it's so big. Very nice having own bathroom.
#####################
8
Very busy doing finishing touches of tidying to house ready for onslaught tomorrow. Say Dr B before chemo 8. Discussed future treatments. Not ready to throw in the towel yet. Treatment went well. Lots of gym running around. E very down - awful day.

Busy morning meeting floor people, sorting out cat + doing Italian h/w. Good lesson of Italian, missed call to say John ill - he went home with Jo (Adam also ill). After sorted tea felt exhausted so to bed early along with everybody else. E has had much better day.
#####################

Today John is ill with sickness and diarrhoea had to leave him alone for a couple of hours to sort out cat, car + daily shop. We have done some fabric painting + general mooching around.

L+M back. Tried + out of sorts. John back to school.

Very stay at home day. L+M not at all well with v. bad cold + jet lag.
#####################
13
All to church. Me cooking very large shoulder of lamb + then off to Wiggington for Toby's football. J+R+I to Borders to spend book vouchers - forgot vouchers!
#####################
14
Mary + I to IKEA. Forgot essentials like handles to return + fridge dimensions. Bought sink + various bits of panelling. To bed very early. Exhausted.
#####################
15
Returned from drop off + felt v. sick. Cleared our room for Tony + then was very sick. Back to bed and slept the rest of the day. Rose came silver in her gym competition - amazing look of surprise on her face. She was eventually thrilled. Nok came first.
#####################
16
Super Italian meal for Action Aid laid on by Luisa. And we did manage an Italian class afterwards. Toby to MacBeth with L+M + Tony - it wasn't very good (no interval to buy ice creams). E + I shopped on the internet for kitchen + spent nearly £2,000. Sore throat setting in - starting to feel very jaded this evening. E bad day, very low.
#####################
17
John had a boa constrictor around his neck today; it stretch up and 'licked' his face. John thought it was lovely!! Then had his photo taken with a tarantula - this was lovely too. Got some antibiotics for sore throat + cough - feel very rough this evening. Floor to be laid tomorrow + we're moving back tomorrow!
#####################

Met up with Alison F for lunch at Melton's Too - had a very nice French Onion soup. Alison is very captivated by Jamie Oliver's school lunch revolution - as am I - and we chatted about this a lot. Popped to library before picking up children. Packed up and moved back home. House felt very damp. Not good for my sore throat.
#####################
19
Spent the afternoon at L+M with Will, Sarah, the children and Sarah's brother + his wife. E off with boys to do the ghost walk in the evening. Rose + I went home.
#####################
20
Sore throat + felling very coldy. Managed the Fox group. Couldn't believe I'd left my book at home with the library book that took me ages to find. Sweet little girls all made a Rosemary cross and Donkey. Spent the afternoon in bed. E suggested La Piazza for tea. Cheered us all up, all the nicer because it was so unexpected. Great pizzas. I had cannelloni. Children enjoyed it - as usual. Toby won gold at trampoline. Rose competed in final, but not placed. She was disappointed, especially after Tuesday's silver.
#####################

Terrible night on the breathing front. I have a cold and 'woke' labouring to breathe. Oxygen mask a must. Felt quite frightened for a while, just about managed to persuade myself it is a <ins>cold</ins>. Took myself off to hospital + picked up more antibiotics, up the steroids + cough mixture. Slow, slow for rest of day. Highlight - watched 'Some like it Hot'. Great movie. T not very impressed although he did laugh quite a lot.
#####################
22
Was going to go to Whitby, but very dam + cold and still not feeling very good. Moochy day. All pretty much suiting themselves, ie T + I as J, R + E off to London for John's Big Toe prize of tour plus tour round TV programme Exchange. M took T + I out for a lovely curry at the Himalayan. Then a cosy TV evening at Mary's until E phoned for pickup from station.
#####################
23
Whitby today with mary leaving E to work. Lovely day. Packed up wheelchair as still not walking very far. Whitby was amazingly busy. Had FnCs as soon as we got there. Then on to the beach. J+R went in. Toby looked out over the harbour for a long time. It was quite busy + interesting. On balance we didn't really do a great deal, but it was a lovely day.
#####################
24
Felt a home based day would be good as we'd all been out the last two days. Blitzed Rose's room and managed to throw out a bin bag full of stuff and pile up a load for the charity shop. Park.
#####################
25
Went to St Clement's children’s activity morning with Mary. A good range of activities including juggling, computer, origami + Mary's Hot X buns. J+R really enjoyed it. Afternoon at home and then last cooked meal at Jo's.
#####################
26
E off to buy paint with John and Rose + I set off to take things to Age Concern + get a bit of shopping. Driving necessary, but feeling better. Lal + Pauline arrived at about 2pm. We played Harry Potter. New 'Dr Who' - Lance arrived in good time to watch this! 7:30 table at Meltons. Me: King Prawn, Hake, choc. Parfait. Lovely wine + dessert wine. Great chees. Very, very nice eventing with L + P v good company. Surrendered our vouchers + Lal treated us to rest - very generous.
#####################
27
Left Toby, Lal + Pauline getting up slowly and cycled off to meeting. A very quiet Meeting. Philip Rack's piece from Faith + Practice came to mind. Discovered after Meeting it was the piece in Quakevine this month - strange that. Did the coffee with a very fragile woman who told me too much too soon. Was joined by Andrew + Ian both of whom always end up singing - have spent quite a few 'drying times' with these two.

All to L+M for a very nice roast lamb dinner followed by meringues. Played 'Perudo' - I won, 'wayhay'! - and then Lal + Pauline set off home. Crumpet + muffin tea. We now have the gas stove. E + I stayed up late watching 'enigma' -very good. Slept well. Feeling much much better.
#####################
28
Brimham Rocks gave us all a much needed 'run' around in the fresh air. Everybody had a good climb, although Toby has 'found fear' and was not leaping up stuff as he once used to. Oversized trainers did not help. Found the 'smartie tube' that Toby wriggled through in yr 7 on a school trip. No takers this time.
#####################
29
Very busy morning shopping. Shoes for Toby, trainers for Rose. Failed attempt to buy sweatshirt for John.

Dave arrived in the late afternoon + started work on the kitchen. E all day painting. It really is starting to look like a room again. Cancelled my chemo - can't face it this week after last week's cold.

Embroider this morning. Working on Binka. Rose making a book mark. John went to the allotment with Mary. Nok came back with us for the afternoon.

Feeling very tired.
#####################

Embroidery part II. Rose to Nok's + then John too and they all went to the cinema. Katharine came for lunch with Thomas. Went to Mary's to bake Rose's cake + make pizza dough. Still very tired. Kitchen coming on - first hitch: stainless edging placed on wrong end of work surface - great!
