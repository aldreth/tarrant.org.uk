Sodens round for breakfast after the 8am birdwalk in the park. All came back boasting new knowledge of bird calls. Managed to accommodate all of us for cooked breakfast. Our new grill in full swing - really good. Set off for Hunmanby Gap despite misgivings about the weather. Bit of a shower en route, but the rest of the day was really lovely. Tide receding. E built a fire and the children donned wetsuits and were barely out of the water. Jo + Bill came for a couple of hours. Didn't get back until about 7 v. tired and hungry.

Set off for Hunmanby about 11 and although traffic a little heavier than yesterday we had pretty much a clear run. We suits again proved invaluable - Rose didn't want to come home. Lovely walking along the beach - no gradient, felt normal. Fantastic view, air, breeze. So very very lovely. Best place we go. Pondered on the day I won;t be able to even walk along the flat. E drove home. Everyone tired + hungry. Went to see 'Downfall' with Jean - a deeply disturbing film about Hitler's last days in power in a bunker in Berlin - horrifying.

Hard week ahead for T with DAT tests plus others - he works hard every night + still manages to get up early for his paper round - great boy.
#####################

Leave my bag @ Italian!! Mary drives me back over, but all is locked. Suddenly remember late evening that tomorrow the hall will be used as a polling station, resolve to get up early. Feel very bereft + worried about not having my bag to hand. Too tired for yoga. Bed early.
#####################

Set off on electric bike at about 8am!! No caretaker because it is polling day!! argh!! Borrow a mobile + phone emergency number. Get caretaker out of bed. Long + short, find bag when E phones my mobile - it's usually turned off for the lesson... what a relief! Enjoy a lovely day at the Forbidden Corner with J+R and Lance. I love this place - such fun. Great picnic of Thai style chicken in rolls + pork pie. Good fruit cake.

E has booked tickets for Nitin Sawhney @ Gateshead. Set off early to look around the Sage and the Gallery. Fantastic building. Great Millennium Bridge although very cold. Enjoyed concert although Nitin doesn't really work the crowd. Delayed train to get home, fell into bed about 1am.

Sletp through time we should have had b/fast @ Mary's. J+R up to listen to dawn chorus with M @ the allotment! Mooched around for most of the day and then all went to see HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy - not quite J+R's thing. T enjoyed.
#####################
8
Did coffee @ Meeting. Everybody else stayed at home. E was going to take J+R on school bike ride, but too cold + wet.
#####################
9
Pick M up at 10 and enjoy drive to Castle Howard. E + I finally decide on a lovely back bamboo and large black flowerpot - very urban chic - and a mock orange. Had my eye on many a tree - would have quickly outgrown the yard. Lovely steak s/wiches for lunch with salad + wine to celebrate M+L wedding anniversary - cheers Lance who was off recording.
#####################
10
Enjoyed early morning cycle along the river with E to meet Ted in the Gallery coffee shop - for the first time. Great view of the Minster from here.
#####################
11
T off for his first babysitting job tonight for Alison. Arrived @ yoga to find Suzi not there - very rare. Pete eventually turned up and - rather reluctantly I feel - agreed to lead the class. (Didn't want T to miss out on his babysitting so pushed to keep us all there!) He's getting very good and is quite impressive with some of his poses. Now, if I had my time again I would definitely work harder + spend more time on yoga.
#####################

Hoping to go to Anita's with Rosie Waring to look at hat production but poor girl could not make it out of the house. Judith eventually persuaded her to go with me and have a look at my sewing machine. She did some stitch samples and I showed her how to do applique in silks. Felt desperately sorry that she cannot go anywhere, meet anybody without feeling a deep anxiety. Arranged to go with her to Boyes tomorrow.
#####################
13
Rosie cried off - she wants to spend time with Judith before she goes off on holiday. Went into town with E to buy present for M + took advantage of book offer on Design C20 + Architecture. Lovely afternoon so sat in the yard - which really is looking very good at the moment. Anna ill, so Rose decides not to go to youth club. Goes to Nok's for sleep over. Tom here for sleep over.
#####################
14
Rose walked to dance on her own. Anna very poorly with persistent cough/cold. Applied liberal layer of choc icing to fudge cake before picking her up. Lovely afternoon at Lal + Pauline's celebrating their new garden + 1st WA. Lots of couples with small children, babies - felt quite old with our lot, especially T. Came hope relatively early because J+R tired out - got home just in time for Dr Who.
#####################
15
Having a very lazy day. E took the children to Meeting and after listening to a gripping radio play - that didn't conclude today! - got up for 11am!! Sitting here in the yard with sun umbrella, it is absolutely lovely. E, J + R + Lil @ the Edmund Wilson and T + Luke on the Xbox. T has bought me a very thoughtful present 'Creature Comforts' (be it at the £ shop - he has a good eye for a bargain!) Will eventually move myself to cook chicken.
#####################
16
Rose not well with a temperature and has stayed at home mooching in pyjamas. Cut out mock trousers for Eleanor before setting off for Leeds. Curious Reiki with Robert - could not discern where he was at times and if he still had his hands on me. Very nice all the same. Lunch of home made soup + wheat germ bread with Ruth + David Corry and then Ruth gave me a foot massage. Magical lying back listening to logs crackle on the fire and the wind chimes in the garden. Collected M from station carrying Betty's fare from her course. Enjoyed a lovely chocolate tart after E's v. nice shepherds pie.
#####################
17
No girls for sewing - tired + ill. No Tom - he's grounded. John jumping around as usual - he has invite to a year 6 girl's party. Toby just about fitting in a bit of revision.

R not really wanting to go back to school - would not kiss me goodbye. E to Harrogate with Ted. Andrew - vicar at St Clements - pops in for tea, very illuminating chat about Cawood. Cath came for lunch - M's bean soup from yesterdays Betty's course - after fighting with her u bend for the best part of the morning. Spent lots on T at Millets for his D of E. Card making for M tomorrow + gym as usual.
#####################
18
Finished M's cake and did some Italian and trouser mending in the morning. E DIY in the kitchen. Italian very good fun - Franco sending me off in the giggles. Booked La Piazza for us all and told him we want to talk Italian! L @ home and we all sang Happy Birthday for M. They are off on holiday for a week to the Baltic. E to scarcroft with J+R for a demonstration drumming lesson and Toby + I to Millthorpe for a German briefing. Dragged myself to yoga - glad I did, very rejuvenating. Milkshake with T on return. Watered garden & part of little + often practice. To bed.
#####################
19
Anna is in hospital with pneumonia. Buy various fripperies for her. Jo is constantly at her bedside + sleeping on a camp bed. All very traumatic. J +R concerned. I think the seriousness of it has sunk in slowly. Lovely coffee break in the yard with E. He's worked all day on the small kitchen window. Collect children + cook fish supper. J to gym + T to cinema with Andy to see the new Star Wars movie. Bob to M + L to turn of washing up machine - bring home lovely flowers. V tired this evening + a bit wheezy.
#####################
20
Met up with Chrissy for lunch @ No 8 - good old chin wag so much so left myself short to do the shopping. R off for a sleepover with Freddie and T going away for D of E weekend in Rosedale. His pack looked worse than it felt. Weather outlook looks good for him. Glad he's getting a good physical weekend after the exam season. Drive over to the Courtyard to see 'Non Contact Time' as part of our Big Deal - much better than D Copperfield. J enjoys having Jean to himself.
#####################
21
Bob into town while E takes J off to dance. Bump into Richard Ogden deliberating over asparagus + have a long chat about veggies + the markedt! Collect R on the way back. Bake a pear flan, while E takes R + J to the park. Drive J to Emily’s birthday party at Water World. He was the only year 5 invited - he later told me he 'coped + had a very good time'. Lovely meal with Judy + Keith - gravalax, Thai style steak + pear tart. Judy brought me a lovely pot stuffed with herbs.
#####################
22
Set off for Hunmanby after breakfast - boot stuffed with body board and skim boards. Tide coming in, bright sun and variable cloud made for a really great 3 hours. R found an ammonite revealed when E managed to crack open the stone. R + J in the water for most of the time. Changing nature of the water is fascinating to watch as the tide moves up the beach. T arrived home looking weathered. He' had a great time and was full of tales of teachers 'coping' with teenagers on a w/end away. Dashed over to L+M to watch Dr Who. Me to bed on return; temperature going up + down and just feeling off. Leave E to cope with washing up, wetsuits + stories.
#####################
23
John Rack came @ 11am for coffee. Has had a serious throat infection that saw him in hospital for 5 days. He was still looking quite grey and scraggy. Still trying to talk himself into justifying his behaviour and a belief that everybody is ok with what has happened except for Debbie. It's all very complex + tortuous + he goes round + Round (as D does when I talk to her) and probably will for a good time to come before he blows himself out. Spent a good hour cutting out clothes for the girls. They spent very little time on these and instead preferred to play outside - which seemed the far better option given how sunny it was and that they've spent all day inside. Walked around the park with J + R after tea - very cold wind. Stroked Chris + Paul's dogs - Amy + Florrie - very sweet dogs.
#####################
24
Sea and I drove over to Castle Howard to shop for plants. Bit of a roan storm when we first arrived that soon broke out to an an almost steamy warm afternoon. Bought another fern, petunias, a hollyhock, herbs of various 'golden' names for M+D + a few other things. Had tea in the teashop & then set back. Lovely afternoon with Swea bought some plants + compost. Spent evening putting plants in, R had to drag me in for story.
#####################
25
Picked up my 'Potato Eaters' - like it very much - E still doesn't like it. Good last Italian lesson - included the barber's song from Figaro. Spent snatches of time sitting in the yard, it really is looking great at the moment.

Judith bought me back a lovely bottle stopper from her holiday in France. Yoga was excellent this evening. Realised I'd been getting the 'locks' wrong - managed it tonight - very energising when done properly.
#####################
26
Lovely warm morning cycling along the river. River watch for a while from the City Screen balcony. Excellent view here of ancient York - ignore the bad bits, namely the hotel. Chat with Cathy over coffee & then do a bit of market shopping. Back home to find E in very low spirits. Finish off the tea prep and then set off for 3:30 appointment. Straight in for scan, never got past 1st page in mags! Curious incident drinking a yogurt drink - man opposite stared hard at me + then asked to borrow a pencil, hurriedly sketched something, returned pencil + tore out piece from magazine most odd! Hope for tea - they have lots of snails!
#####################
27
Horror - a snail or slug has eaten one of my hollyhock leaves - I'm setting up a barricade of eggshells.

Carol has some amazing ferns in her garden, along with a carpet of ble forget-me-not like weeks. It looked like a wild woodland. Drank coffee with her and Claire and then back vie the Blakeshead for a lovely lunch with E. Assembly for J + R. Finished off cooking for Mum + Dad's do around tea time. M came for E + I to go to the theatre 'Gluey + the Lion' - really excellent. Glass of wine + chat with M. Super day.
#####################
28
Bit of an effort getting up today, but need to get going to Mandy's. Had a good b/fast before the long 5 hour drive - busy, but shopping on the way. Launched straight into 'party mode' getting food ready and enjoying drinks. M+D arrived and we had a nice gentle afternoon/evening of food, wine + chat. Managed to all squeeze in on bits of floor.
#####################
29
A slow morning and then over to Mum + Dad's via the back route - very pretty countryside. Children enjoyed running around the garden. After lunch we walked around Prinstead - largely unspoilt. Lovely reedbeds back from the shore. Would love to walk the whole perimeter of Chichester Harbour + resolve to buy OS map for M+D. Later ask Dave if he has one - not to hand! Amaze myself at how little we got to know our locality as children + wonder if my children will feel the same about Yorkshire. Certainly feel cheated that we can't weekends now,, just as all of them would now walk. Sigh.

BEACH!

Get ourselves together after breakfast + Mandy makes a picnic. Stokes Bay is sunny, windy and pretty empty. Set up 'camp' on the beach. J + R straight away make for the water. Dave, E, T + Tom play boule. Windsurfers, sail boats + ferries aplenty. Absolutely gorgeous. Soak up more sun in the suntrap at the front of the house before supper.

Long, but steady drive back, roads surprisingly empty. Fall into bed about 11:30.
#####################
31
E to Dr for 9:25. Cook us all a nice breakfast + then make for scan results... so miserable go an have a coffee at Capaldi's + wish E was there. Pull myself together and have a nice afternoon in the yard. R with Hope and J + T bumbling around. E has terrible tummy cramps & goes to bed early. Watch Creature Comforts with T who lost his e-bay phone bid - there'll be more!
