Took Toby off to help buy tiles + shopping. J+R stayed at home John in his pyjamas until 11 I believe! General party preparations amidst making lunch, tea, etc. Mary cycled John to the theatre and took the girls in the car. Just made it. Horrendous traffic. Good play - Snow White - a little young maybe. Nice pizza tea - Jo cooked the pizzas for us. B.day cake, passs the parcel + Kim's game. Gemma, Anna & Fran - all very nice. Washed up in new sink!

Il Giornale is too difficult for me! Lovely morning. J + R + I do a round tour of Bishy shops. After lunch Rose goes to Lauren's & J + I cycle into town for cupboard handles + red jumper. Buy a CD for Rose. Phone Toby to join us for ice creams, our first @ Capaldi's this year. Nice to sit with J + T looking up at the Minster - bit covered in scaffolding. Mandy arrives - lovely to see her. Dave struggling over a short for too long in the evening. The Pope dies.

Rose in a 7am to open pressies. All on the bed including the cat. All to Meeting - kicked off with the Pope. Toby + I did feather icing biscuits. Took Lily home on the footplate of the bike. Enjoyed Rowntree Park's Green Play Day. Helped Mandy tidy the yard - looks much better. Dave + Mandy tiling. E + I took children to the allotment for L+M's bonfire. Like a warm summer's evening

Children home for training day. Mandy working with Dave in kitchen. They can't make up their minds what to do so end up taking R+J into town to spend b/day money. Toby does things with Andy. Nice supper of spinach and lamb curry.
#####################
5
Treatment - Mandy comes + I fall asleep mid infusion - how sociable! We have a nice soup at Spurriergate. Mandy sets off back home. She's done loads for us as usual. Dave working as hard as ever. Things really taking shape.
#####################
6
IKEA first thing to return stuff + pick up final bits for David. Just make it back in time for Italian - very rusty.
#####################
7
Dentist with Toby first thing, then lots of bits + pieces shopping for Dave and for Toby's birthday.

Fatigue setting in, along with a bit of back pain.
#####################
8
Feeling very nauseous today + so so tired. Manage to go to the dump with Dave + do domesticy bits + pieces. Fall asleep while John + Rose play at the Soden's after school. Pain in back + legs setting in. Definitely a 'side-effects' day.

J decides to give dance a miss and comes into town with me after dropping Rose at dance. We buy fish + then head back again. David + Helen have arrived on return. Toby's b/day he opens pressies in bed ritual on return from paper-round. Tom, Josh & Alex come for FnCs, DVD + X box game. Squeeze in sparkling + crostini + salmon supper with H+D. Hectic, but lovely day. So very happy too see Toby 14. Dave leaves 5ish after v. v. busy day.

H+D to Mass, J+R+T and me to Meeting. E doing some work. Toby got his bike sorted out by Josh Parker. Nice chat with Carol who I haven't seen for ages. E cooked us a nice salmon + mushroom pasta for lunch. E then off to Rotherham with J for gym. R, D+H and I over the river to look at some of the art on the open arts w/end. Dropped them off at the station for 4pm then R + I to the park. A great tree climber. J returns triumphant with the gold - fantastic! Me very sleepy on the sofa - could hardly keep my eyes open.

So lovely to have the house moving back to normality. No building work and no more cramped back room. Slowly decanting boxes into cupboards - it's all a very tight squeeze. Lovely Reiki with Robert - very very relaxing. J+R walked back home by themselves! E terrible, terrible day, he looked so drained. Took the children to the park after a shower and he looked much lifted.

Started 4th Anne book with Rose + a book for J. He's not had much reading to lately.

E awful day - observed by somebody from county. Has been given choices. Writing this 2 weeks late and can only think - remember this. Chat at gym club.
#####################
13
E comes home from school mid-morning. Really can't take any more. I am relieved that the something I have been waiting to happen has happened. E decides he's not realistically going to get on top of the class. Decision made to resign. We spend the rest of the week getting used to the idea.
#####################
14
Have a surge in tidying up the house after the kitchen aftermath. E touches up paint in the kitchen. Boxes get unpacked. Clear Rose's wardrobe for her and move stuff to storage boxes under the bed. Sort out mess of sewing stuff in our room.
#####################
15
Play a few games of 'Happy Families' with J+R after tea. Such a relief to see E enjoying relaxing with us all. As though a great weight has been lifted from his shoulders. Rose is a mean 'happy families' player!!
#####################
16
Toby, Tom, Josh + E off to go-carting birthday treat. Have a great time. Toby wants to go again.
#####################
17
Decide on Humanby Gap this afternoon. The Campbells decide to go too and puc up Luke Holman on the way. The big boys all have wet suits and spend ages in the water on the body board. J+R brave the sea in costumes. J endures for longer. Great fun on skim boards. David builds a fire. Hot tea + coffee in flasks, chocolate, fruit cake, Lebanese bread + honey. Fabulous. Stay for a good three hours enjoying the fire, sun and lovely, lovely beach.
#####################
18
E to the doctor today.

Writing retrospectively + can't think what else we all did. The days really can just drift by and although I'm always busy there is not much to separate them - just like going to work was really!
#####################
19
Bobbed into Sam;s for coffee & chat this morning - always nice to spend time with Sam. Rose off sick with a temperature & need to get back for E to play badminton with Simon + then go into school for final chat. He seems to be feeling glad to get things sorted so that he can move on. Dr S has signed him off for as long as is needed.
#####################
20
Shopped in the morning for a black shrug + bits & pieces. Came home for coffee. Swea came and I went off for Italian - good fun as usual.
#####################
21
A sewing day finishing off Rose's outfit - I really didn't want to be doing it last minute. Very pleased with pink tweed weave top and grey trousers. Katharine + Jane popped in for tea and then busy to and froing for gym club.
#####################
22
Harrogate with Jane + Katharine for a sauna. Can't sit in the heat for as long as I used to and absolute hell getting up that hill from the baths - think it will have to be the wheelchair next time, or really just forget it. Great tapas for lunch - must go with E some time.
#####################
23
Dropped Rose at dance then rushed off to shop before dashing to M+L to paint gold on J+A's cake. T+I cycled to the registry office for simple, but moving, celebration. Jane cried. She looked lovely in red silk. Back to M+L for wine, speeches + good food. Toby + Tom fantastic as waiters and general dogsbodies. Lots of chat + food + wine + champers - all very very nice.
#####################
24
Official unveiling of the children's wall hanging at Meeting this morning. Brenda has made a great job of it. Left Toby + Rose still sleeping. J up at 7am as usual! Lunch finishing wedding feast at M+L. J+R played with the hose + T off to play football. Went to Carol + Nick's wedding. Packed out and a very nice Meeting. Nick's mum read the Gilbran poem that I recognised from our wedding. Sun still in the yard when I got home so made the most of it. Old kitchen going tomorrow so will be able to spread out more.
#####################
25
Judy came for coffee bringing shoots of parsley + rocket that she has grown from seed. Met up with Ruth (never met her before), Lucy Amos, Helen Cadbury (her 40th) for lunch. Danielle + Cathy popped in quickly. M2 - very nice. Dashed for bloodtest before picking up children. Sewing with the girls - they all want to make clothes!
#####################
26
Treatment this morning - last one. Scan in 6 weeks and then we'll see. It's not over yet, a few more drug packages available - making my face flush thinking about time running out! Dr B says I've done well - not chucking the towel in yet. Nice lunch with E. Struggled to sit & do Italian don't know why - it was easy. T cooked - v good.
#####################
27
Managed Italian and from then onf felt extremely tired. Went to bed early and slept soundly.
#####################
28
Very slow day at home. Back ache and feeling very very fatigued. Know it won't last. Watched John gym himself into overall 3rd, winning gold in the Pommel. Home for 9:30 - all very tired. E+T to the theatre - v good.
#####################
29
Rose good work assembly. She did not look - and indeed was not - as though she was enjoying it.

West Yorkshire Playhouse for David Copperfield in the evening. Very slow. We both nodded of at intervals. Very interesting set revealing a stage that goes back far further than has ever been revealed. Jean babysat.
#####################
30
Coffee with Jean after dropping Rose off for dance. Then drive Toby to Keith's and have a quick cup of tea with Judy. J+R to the dance show with Bill leaving E + I with an afternoon. Cycled into town to buy fish and then watched Grand Designs - very decadent afternoon behaviour.

Nice salmon for tea followed by family viewing of Dr Who. Have started embroidering Jane's guests signatures.
