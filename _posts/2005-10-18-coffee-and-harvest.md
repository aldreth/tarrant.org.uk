<p>I had coffee with Michelle this morning at the Blakehead Bookshop and Caf&eacute; - oh yeah and a huge plate of mushrooms on toast.  Long chat.  She had Dominic with her - what a charming child, smiley and cheerful.</p>
<p>Then in the afternoon it was John and Rose's Harvest festival.  Excellent as all Scarcroft things seem to be at the moment.  Rose's class sang several WWII songs - not really a harvest link, but...  John's class didn't do a huge amount - 1 poem - but I expect that all their effort went into last Friday's superb Good Work Assembly.</p>
<p>John has no gym this week or next, and Rose was taken by Jenny and picked up by Mark, so not a busy evening.  Early to bed.</p>
