Toby started year 10 yesterday - looking very smart in his blue T-shirt
(lower school wear white - he\'s really a big boy now!) He has either
music or Design Technology each day which he sees as light relief, so
he\'s pleased with his timetable.

John (year 6 - last year at Scarcroft) and Rose (year 5 - Ms Gornall)
back today. All up and dressed nice and early. Rose and Anna making
plans to walk to school by themselves, as Tom and John do already. So I
may soon be redundent for the school run. They seem excited to be back
at school. This afternoon they are being picked up by Claire and Beth
Gillam and are going around to their house to make fabric roses. This
was arranged yesterday when Claire and Beth popped round to say hello,
show off several textiles projects they had done and show us pictures of
Kit\'s wedding.

Cindy came down the stairs on her bottom relatively early today, about
11am. We went down the road to do some food shopping and she\'s now
waiting for Ruth Corry to come and visit her.
