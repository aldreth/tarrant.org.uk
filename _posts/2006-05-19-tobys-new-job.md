<p>Well that didn't take long!!</p>
<p>It isn't really a new job, because it'll still be at the newsagent's.  Two hours from 6am to 8am on Saturday and Sunday morning working in the shop sorting out papers, serving customers and other things - it'll become clearer what exactly when he starts - tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Toby says that the best thing is that as he won't be ruining his bike by  using it to deliver papers, and ruining it, he can get a nice new mountain bike.</p>
