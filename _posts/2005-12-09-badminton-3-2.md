<p>I carry on trying to play badminton regularly.  I've had to miss a few games over the last month or so, as people have been off school so often, but I've played twice this week to try and make up for it.</p>
<p>I still play <a href="https://palmour.blogspot.com">Simon</a> most regularly, and he still generally beats me - in fact it was a whitewash this week - oh well I beat him last week for a change.  Today I played against Mark, who hasn't played much for ages, so I won fairly easily.  However, I think once he loses his rustiness it'll be a different matter as he's got an amazing smash - which just frightens me - when it goes over the net ;-).</p>
<p>John's been at home today, just exhausted I think because of the school play and so on this week.  Rose has been to school every day this week - the first time for ages.  Toby, of course, is doing his paper round, school, youth club, squash... as usual.</p>
