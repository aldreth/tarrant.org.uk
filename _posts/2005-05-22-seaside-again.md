<p>We've been to Hunmanby Gap again today.  Some skimming, some body boarding.</p>
<p>John jumped off a submerged rock into, over, through waves for half an hour.  They both hunted for fossils and found several <a href="http://www.discoveringfossils.co.uk/Myths.htm">"Devils Toenails"</a> and Rose found a nice <a href="http://www.discoveringfossils.co.uk/Ammonites.htm">ammonite</a>.</p>
<p>Toby's just got home from his weekend and has had a good time, not too exhausted, all quite easy apparently, although another group managed to get lost, gave up and sat down waiting for help!</p>
