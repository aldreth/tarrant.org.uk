<p>John, Rose and I cycled this morning along the cycle track to Naburn on the <a href="http://www.scarcrofthsp.org.uk/">Scarcroft HSP</a> cycle ride.  Nice leisurely ride that we all managed easily with lunch at Naburn.</p>
<p>Then this afternoon we went to see <a href="http://www.wallaceandgromit.com">Wallace and Gromit</a>.  Excellent film really enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>After a lovely tea of lamb chops for John and I and spinach and feta pie for Rose, we went to pick up Toby from the station.  He's had a lovely time with Jane and Andy - really enjoyed himself and has come home full of the joys of the big city!  Lovely to have him back.</p>
