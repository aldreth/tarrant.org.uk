<p>I went with Ted today over to Harrogate to go to the Turkish Baths (info <a href="http://www.harrogate.gov.uk/harrogate-1100">here</a> and <a href="http://www.victorianturkishbath.org/_6DIRECTORY/AtoZEstab/England/HarrogRoyal/HarrogRoyalEng.htm">here</a>).</p>
<p>As usual, wonderfully relaxing and pleasant experience.  Followed by tapas, then back on the train just in time to pick the children up from school.</p>
<p>Sheer luxury - definitely better than being at work!</p>
