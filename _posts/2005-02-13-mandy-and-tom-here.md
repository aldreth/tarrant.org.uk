Mandy and Tom have come to visit for a few days. Tom\'s half term has
just started - unlike ours, which is just finishing. Toby and Tom have
spent ages on various computers, and have been to the park to drive
Toby\'s car (but a wheel fell off - not even my fault! - it\'s only a
screw.) Mandy, John, Rose and I went to a Viking Craft Trading Fair (!)
full of people in chain mail buying drinking horns and so on.

Cindy hasn\'t been out today as she\'s getting a bit of a cold. Her next
chemo is on Tuesday. Mandy and Tom also go home on Tuesday, taking a
huge list of kitchen jobs for David - he\'s ripping our kitchen out at
the end of the month. Exciting.
