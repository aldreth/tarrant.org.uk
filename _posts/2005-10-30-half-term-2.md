<p>We've had a busy week, which is one reason I haven't written about it, and the other is that we were away from computers for half of it.</p>
<p>From Saturday morning to Tuesday evening the four of us went to Hunstanton.  We stayed in the <a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/hostelpages/101.html">youth hostel</a>, ate a couple of meals in an excellent <a href="http://www.roseandcrownsnettisham.co.uk">pub</a>, lots more nice meals elsewhere, went on a boat trip to see seals, ten pin bowled, went swimming, walked along the beach, watched paragliders, went to the cinema, saw butterflies, birds and llamas at a wildlife centre and generally had a good time.</p>

<p>Once we had got home, Rose in particular had a busy time.  She went to Young Embroiderers with Nok on two mornings, and to a wood working thing on another with Lily.</p>
<p>John and Toby went to the Apple Mac show in London with Lance on Friday - and came home with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> each, and one for Rose.  What an extravagent grandfather they have.  They arrived home at about 11:30pm, and couldn't go to bed till they had got music onto one of them, and had a listen.  Saturday was therefore spent putting music onto these amazing little things (and story books in Rose's case).  No one need fight over the car radio again - or even talk to each other in the car!</p>
<p>Friday evening Kath came round for a meal.  She had been going to bring Louis too, but with the boys being off and Louis having a party, it was just her.  Very good to sit and chat to her.  Nice meal too.</p>
<p>We saw Jane and her friend Merrial on Saturday.  They took Rose to have her hair cut at <a href="http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/1999/10/28/321250.html">Glen &amp; Julio's</a> - which was an experience apparently.  Toby went to watch Huddersfield with Keith.  We had supper at Lance and Mary's.</p>
<p>Today we went to Meeting for the first time since Cindy's funeral.  I knew I would find it very difficult and I did.  Lasted about 20 minutes and then sat in the library with Cathy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went swimming (took Lily too), then John and Rose went out to a Halloween Party at Lottie and Polly's.  I made a lovely <a href="http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/534274">lamb and spinach curry</a> for tea.</p>
