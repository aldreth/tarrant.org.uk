<p>I went over to Will and Sarah's today to take Sarah to hospital.  She's got a bad case of conjunctivitis which had been agravated by eye drops she had been given.  Her sight wasn't up to driving, and she wanted someone to look after Jack and Grace while she was seeing the doctor.  She got another appointment for next week, but the doctor reckoned she should be ok.</p>
