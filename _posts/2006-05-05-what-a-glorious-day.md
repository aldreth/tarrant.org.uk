I\'m sure it\'s mainly the weather, but I\'ve had a lovely day today. It
was really warm and sunny and made me feel very cheerful.

I went to yoga at lunch time. There were only four of us there, and Rob
looked around and said \"As you\'re all quite experienced,\" (I was
feeling good already) \"we\'ll have an energetic session.\" And it was.
It left me feeling very stretched and energised, ready for the rest of
the day and weekend.

I was supposed to be playing squash with Mark in the afternoon, and
after that yoga I\'m sure I\'d have beaten him, but he was being sick.
So instead I played croquet with Lance and very civilised it was too. I
got the children from school and chatted in the sun for a while before
going to Lance and Mary\'s. John had his first swimming lesson, so we
had a good cycle across Hob Moor.

In the evening, I went to the theatre with Jackie. We went to see
[Foxes][1], a play about asylum seekers in Leeds.
