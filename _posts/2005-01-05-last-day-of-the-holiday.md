We decided to have a proper day out today, before school starts
tomorrow. We all went over to [Eureka][1] in Halifax, on the train, with
Jo, Tom, Anna and Adam.

The first time I went to Eureka was with Toby when he was about 3 or 4.
About half the museum is the same, the rest has been changed. I think it
was the first totally interactive science museum I had been to and it
really impressed me. Now, after going to lots of others, particularly
[Magna][2], it seems much less exciting. The children still enjoyed it
and got a lot out of it. I expect that this will be the last time Toby
goes - I was quite surprised that he wanted to go today.

We got back home and had fish and chips for tea. John and Rose are in
bed now, as is Cindy who is exhausted after her chemo yesterday.
