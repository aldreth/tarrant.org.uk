<p>I think I've picked up some work this morning.  Someone that Simon knows wants to withdraw her children from Tregelles and teach them at home.  Except that she doesn't actually want to teach them herself, so it looks like I'll be teaching them three mornings a week from next academic year.  Slightly odd situation, but it should be fairly straightforward work.</p>
<p>Then this afternoon, I went with Rose's class to watch an <a href="http://www.theatre-centre.co.uk/show_details.asp?showID=25">adaption</a> of Journey to the River Sea at the Theatre Royal.  It was very imaginatively done, but the story was quite hard to follow (I don't know it) and Rose said they missed out some of the best bits!</p>
<p>Rose and John went off swimming with Gemma this evening, and Toby and I had the lovely soup at a reasonable time.  By the time they got back from swimming, Rose was too tired really to eat, so she'll be starving in the morning.</p>
