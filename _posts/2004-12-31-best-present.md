Mary and Lance gave us Big Deal tickets for the [West Yorkshire
Playhouse][1] as a Christmas Present. This gives you a choice of 4 out
of 5 plays that are on from now until the summer. Cindy phoned and
booked them all yesterday, so we\'ve got dates in the diary for [A
Doll\'s House][2], [David Copperfield][3] and [The 39 Steps][4]. One of
the other two plays is a series of new plays by new Leeds writers, so
we\'ve got tickets for all three - three separate shows for £10! Because
we\'ve booked nice and early, we\'ve got the best seats in the house
each time - full price tickets are £20-£25. A fantastic present - we\'ve
got 6 evenings at the theatre to look forward to.

We\'re also going to [The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe][5] next week
and [Don Givovanni][6] at Opera North the week after that!
