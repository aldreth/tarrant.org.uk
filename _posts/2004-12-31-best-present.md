<p>Mary and Lance gave us Big Deal tickets for the <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com">West Yorkshire Playhouse</a> as a Christmas Present.  This gives you a choice of 4 out of 5 plays that are on from now until the summer.  Cindy phoned and booked them all yesterday, so we've got dates in the diary for <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=437">A Doll's House</a>, <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=439">David Copperfield</a> and <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=440">The 39 Steps</a>.  One of the other two plays is a series of new plays by new Leeds writers, so we've got tickets for all three - three separate shows for &pound;10!  Because we've booked nice and early, we've got the best seats in the house each time - full price tickets are &pound;20-&pound;25.  A fantastic present - we've got 6 evenings at the theatre to look forward to.</p>
<p>We're also going to <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=159">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> next week and <a href="https://www.operanorth.co.uk/operazone/omhome.aspx?opera=18">Don Givovanni</a> at Opera North the week after that!</p>
