Dave went home on Saturday after lunch. He left a kitchen with a new
plasterboard ceiling, total rewiring and all ready for the dampproof
company. I\'ve finished stripping the wood chip off the walls and so
that is all ready to be plastered. The next stage starts on Wednesday
when the floor will be dug up - should take about a week to finish
laying the new floor and plaster walls and ceiling.

We\'ve decamped to my parents\' house for a fortnight or so - being out
of the dust is a relief for everyone, especially Cindy. I\'m at home
today, and working the rest of the week.
