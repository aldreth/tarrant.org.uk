It\'s Friday afternoon, and the children have come home for the start of
two and a half weeks of Christmas holiday.

John and Rose have had a very busy, Christmasy week at school. They\'ve
watched the infant\'s Nativity Play, sung a carol concert in school, met
Father Christmas and had class parties. On Thursday morning, they had a
school carol concert and [Christingle ][1]in [St Clements Church][2].
Cindy, Lance and I all went to listen/watch - Mary had been going to go,
but had to finish an essay for her course for that afternoon! The
concert (not a service - even though it was in a church - there was one
sort of prayer) was very good, excellent singing, brass and woodwind and
the excellent Scarcroft drummers. It is a very good school for music, I
think and Mrs Cornhill must have contributed a lot to that.

Toby\'s school, on the other hand, has been determinedly unChristmasy. I
think he said that there is a Christmas tree up, and the staff did a
panto for pupils this afternoon, but that\'s it. They\'ve done all the
usual end of term stuff - videos, quizzes etc and then he got out early
this afternoon. When he got home we went off to get a Christmas tree,
which is now filling the corner of our front room waiting to be
decorated tomorrow.
