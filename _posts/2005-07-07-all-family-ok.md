Jane and Katharine and partners/child are all ok, following the bomb in
London [today][1]. Been exchanging phone calls and texts with them and
friends in London today - all well with people we know.

Frightening. We\'re intending to go down to London next week, I\'m sure
all will be clear by then, but we\'ll have to wait and see.
