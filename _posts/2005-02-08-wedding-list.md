In a very sad, geeky way, I\'m very proud of a new website I\'ve set up
for my sister Jane\'s [wedding list][1].

I\'ve used the [php][2] web scripting language with a [mysql][3]
database to make a site that makes presents disappear when someone has
said that they will buy them, it\'ll email Jane and Andy to tell them
that someone has selected an item and you can add items to the list
through the internet. It\'s really something like an Amazon wishlist for
whatever you want - even if it\'s not on amazon (though most things are
these days!)

If you\'re feeling as geeky as me you can play with a diferent version
that won\'t affect Jane and Andy\'s presents [here][4].
