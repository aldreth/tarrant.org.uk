<p>Millthorpe have got a training day today, so John and Toby are at home.&nbsp; John and I are going together to Tropical World in Leeds to look at butterflies and things and then coming home for Rose's assembly - she won a &pound;10 voucher in a raffle for people who cycled to school (!) and is going to have it presented to her this afternoon.</p>
<p>There was a fantastic <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1920095,00.html">article</a> by Mark Thomas in yesterday's Guardian all about the withdrawal of the right to protest near the Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; Apparently people are protesting about this by sticking to the letter of the law - and producing huge amounts of paperwork for the police.</p>
