When I was at Meeting yesterday I picked up a letter that was waiting
for me in the pigeon holes.

It was from Oxfam and said that £872.01 had been donated at Cindy\'s
funeral. I\'ve also had a few other letters from their central office
telling me that other people had donated money in memory of Cindy. So
the grand total must be nearly £1000.
