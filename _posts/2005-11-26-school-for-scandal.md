<p>I've just got all the children into bed after coming back from seeing <a href="http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/archive-events/events136.shtml">The School for Scandal</a> at York Theatre Royal.  It was colourful, funny, bright and interesting - all things that last week's Hamlet weren't.  Unfortunately it was also <em>long</em> and combined with the heat this sent both John and Rose to sleep - one on either side of me.</p>
<p>Earlier on today, Toby went to see Huddersfield <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/4448738.stm">play</a> with Keith; John, Rose & I played the Harry Potter boardgame and then Rose went off to play with Lily.</p>
