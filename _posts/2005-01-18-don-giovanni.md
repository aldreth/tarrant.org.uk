<p>We went to the opera last night with Keith and Judy.  Before it started, we went for a meal at Fruits and Shoots, a vegetarian restaurant which is just round the corner from the Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the opera - the costumes seemed a bit of a hotch-potch, most in sort of 30s style, and one not at all.  The singing and playing though were excellent - I particularly liked Leporello's voice.</p>
<p>Not particularly knowing the opera, I couldn't see how they were going to have a second half - as they caught Don Giovanni and were just about to have their revenge, when... he escaped!  The second half was a bit bizarre, with an invitation to a meal issued to the statue of a dead man - who then turned up and took Don Giovanni down to hell.</p>
<p>The final bit of singing, which sounds very joyful when sung in Italian, turns out to mean "All sinners will go to hell."  Odd.</p>
<p>I suppose you don't particularly go to opera for the coherence of the plot.</p>
