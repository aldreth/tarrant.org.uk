It would have been Cindy\'s birthday tomorrow so we went out for a meal
with Lance and Mary to celebrate. A good way to spend her pension. We
would have gone out on the day itself, but it\'s the Millthorpe open
evening - John needs to go as a model pupil and Rose and I are going to
look around in preparation for next year.
