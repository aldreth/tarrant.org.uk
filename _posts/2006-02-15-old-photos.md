<p>We were looking through lots of old photos last night, and Rose wanted a copy of the some of her eating when she was a baby.  While I was scanning those, I did some others from the same album.  Some are of the children, some are of Cindy and one is of me.  They must be from about 1997, Toby was 6, John 2 and Rose 1.</p>
