<p>Edward is deep in SAT's land this week with light relief provided by a very nice art project creating a pattern using felt that will culminate in a banner.<br />
he has about 4 applications in at the moment and is having a week of doubt that a job is ever going to happen.  Something will come up soon I'm sure. We all had a busy weekend and Edward took John and Rose to a music event at the Early Music Centre  on Saturday for a show of Indian dance, poetry and music.  Greatly enjoyed by all.  He then took them all off to Meeting on Sunday while I helped katherine put the finising touches to her puddings for the 40th Wedding Celebration of lance and Mary.</p>
