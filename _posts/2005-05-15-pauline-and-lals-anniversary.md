<p>It was Lal and Pauline's first anniversary, so they had a party to celebrate.  They've also done a lot to their garden, so it was a garden christening party too.  We went over on Saturday afternoon, after J+R's dancing (John didn't go - too tired!).</p>
<p>Pauline had done some lovely food - dips, salmon, salads...  Cindy had done a chocolate fudge cake (from Nigella Lawson - yum yum).</p>
<p>We didn't stay as long as we'd intended, because the children were worn out!  We got home in time for Doctor Who (Doctor Who actually moving shock - it was the one about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/fathersday.shtml">Rose's dad</a>).</p>
<p>And so to bed - early.  Sleepovers definitely only at weekends - on a school day this level of borderline grumpiness would have been unbearable!</p>
