<p>On Friday evening I went to see Jerusalem at the WYP with Lance, while Mary looked after the children (babysat is no longer the right word).  Judy and Keith, to whom I had given the tickets, had discovered that they couldn't go after all, so after looking for anyone else who was free, I went.</p>
<p>It was a very good play, seven actors who all played instruments and sang.  They burst into modern pop tunes at various points to fit into the story.  The put upon son sang a Smiths song and the granny sang a very drunken, aggressive version of Take Me Out.  I'm glad I've been back to the WYP before we go to see Alice in Wonderland in the new year.</p>
<p>On Saturday Rose went to a birthday party, and then to a sleep-over.  Toby and I went to see Hamlet at the Theatre Royal with Lance and Mary, and John was looked after by Jean.  Hamlet seemed really dull, so Toby and I left at half time!</p>
<p>On Sunday, John had a gym competition, in which he won silver for his floor.  He'd made up the routine himself and it was brilliant.  Rose was at the dance festival with school and did a really good dance to Chattanooga Choo Choo.  Then we went out to La Piazza, followed by Harry Potter at the City Screen.</p>
<p>Very busy weekend.</p>
