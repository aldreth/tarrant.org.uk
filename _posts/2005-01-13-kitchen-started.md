<p>Cindy & I went to Ikea today, and spent a load of money on kitchen units.  So things are finally underway.  We've been saving to do the kitchen for ages - since I started working really, and thinking about it for even longer.  Now the units and worktops are ordered, we've chosen oven, hob, extractor and someone is coming to look at the damp wall and floor next week.  The floor and floor are the big unknown item really, we don't know how bad it is, or how much of the floor will need digging up.</p>
<p>It's exciting starting at last.</p>
<p>Short entry as I'm finding it difficult to type.  I cut a finger on my left hand really badly the other day (knife was too blunt when chopping carrots!)</p>
