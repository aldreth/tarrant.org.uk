<p>Cindy went in today for her sixth chemo in this round.  She is fine this evening, but will no doubt get exhaused over the next few days.  The side effects of this sort of chemo aren't too bad though, and because it seems to be having a positive effect Dr Bottomley has suggested that Cindy have a few (2-4) more doses, spaced 3 weeks apart as so far.</p>
<p>Cindy is doing pretty well.  She is a lot less short of breath, can get upstairs without needing oxygen or having to pause and generally has more energy than in October/November.  As usual, she is amazingly positive, vibrant and full of enthusiam.</p>
