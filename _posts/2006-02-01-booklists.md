<p>The Guardian published <a href="https://books.guardian.co.uk/childrensfictionprize2005/story/0,,1698740,00.html">top 10 book lists</a> that three authors think children should have read by the time they leave school.</p>
<p>I've read most of the books in JK Rowling's and Philip Pullman's lists, and only two (plus watching the play of a third) of Andrew Motion's list.  His looks very intellectual to me.</p>
