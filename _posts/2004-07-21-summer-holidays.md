<p>It's been ages since we added anything, so here's a general round up of events of the last month or so.</p>
<p>Cindy is off treatment and is generally feeling fine - she's got a cold at the moment, so is rather breathless, but it should go soon.</p>
<p>Edward has finished at Wheldrake, to his great relief!  The last few weeks dragged like anything.  Now he's starting to get ready for his new job.</p>
<p>The children are enjoying the start of the holiday.</p>
<p>In late June we had a fantastic party at Lance and Mary's.  It was on a Sunday afternoon, we had about 100 guests, Cindy had done lots of wonderful food and everyone drank quite a lot.  Perhaps it should become an annual event.</p>
