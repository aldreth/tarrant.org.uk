<p>Cindy went over to the Cancer Care Centre for a 9:45 appointment this morning for her third round of chemo and an appointment with Dr Bottomley.</p>
<p>Again the chemo wasn't too bad, a couple of hours on a drip and not too uncomfortable.  On her way home she "popped into town" to do some Christmas shopping - where does she get the energy?</p>
<p>She seems fine this evening, we're expecting that she will have a few more days of feeling exhaused and that more hair will fall out.</p>
<p>She is due to have another scan on Thursday, and we should get the results of that next week.</p>
