So (see comment [here][1]), what was reiki like?

Well... while trying to remain scientific and sceptical - I certainly
enjoyed it and definitely feel more energised yesterday evening and
today. I think I felt an unusual amount of heat from Robert\'s hands and
a sometimes a peculiar tingling sensation where his hands were resting.
Is this just because he has warm hands and my legs were falling asleep.
Hard to tell. I definitely felt slightly spaced afterwards for a while,
and more *awake*. I\'m sure that just talking to someone for half an
hour and then having a rest/snooze has some effect though!

Will I go back - at the moment I think I probably will, I\'ll see how I
feel in a few days.
