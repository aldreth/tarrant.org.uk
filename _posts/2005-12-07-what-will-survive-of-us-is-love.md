<blockquote><strong>Philip Larkin - An Arundel Tomb</strong></p>
<p>Side by side, their faces blurred,<br />
The earl and countess lie in stone,<br />
Their proper habits vaguely shown<br />
As jointed armour, stiffened pleat,<br />
And that faint hint of the absurd -<br />
The little dogs under their feet.</p>
<p>Such plainness of the pre-baroque<br />
Hardly involves the eye, until<br />
It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still<br />
Clasped empty in the other; and<br />
One sees, with a sharp tender shock,<br />
His hand withdrawn, holding her hand.</p>
<p>They would not think to lie so long.<br />
Such faithfulness in effigy<br />
Was just a detail friends would see:<br />
A sculptor's sweet commissioned grace<br />
Thrown off in helping to prolong<br />
The Latin names around the base.</p>
<p>They would no guess how early in<br />
Their supine stationary voyage<br />
The air would change to soundless damage,<br />
Turn the old tenantry away;<br />
How soon succeeding eyes begin<br />
To look, not read. Rigidly they</p>
<p>Persisted, linked, through lengths and breadths<br />
Of time. Snow fell, undated. Light<br />
Each summer thronged the grass. A bright<br />
Litter of birdcalls strewed the same<br />
Bone-littered ground. And up the paths<br />
The endless altered people came,</p>
<p>Washing at their identity.<br />
Now, helpless in the hollow of<br />
An unarmorial age, a trough<br />
Of smoke in slow suspended skeins<br />
Above their scrap of history,<br />
Only an attitude remains:</p>
<p>Time has transfigures them into<br />
Untruth. The stone fidelity<br />
They hardly meant has come to be<br />
Their final blazon, and to prove<br />
Our almost-instinct almost true:<br />
What will survive of us is love.</p></blockquote>
