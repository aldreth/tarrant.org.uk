<p>Last few preparations - present wrapping, turkey delivery (thanks Mark - who got up at four and got ours as well as his), a party this evening and carols at Meeting.  Rose is doing a reading at Meeting, which will be brilliant.  We've also got to try and fit in driving Toby's car this afternoon.</p>
<p>Currently putting Cold War technology to good use by <a href="https://www.noradsanta.org/english/radar/index.html">tracking Santa</a>.</p>
