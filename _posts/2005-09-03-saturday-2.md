<p>Boring title I know - never mind.</p>
<p>In the morning: Toby went off to play squash for the first time at York RI.  He's stopping playing football, so decided to find a new sport and squash fits the bill well - local, indoor, so all year round, fast and energetic.  He had a really good session and is going again on Tuesday.</p>
<p>John, Rose and I went down to Bishopthorpe Road for shopping and sweets.  We bought back buns.  I ate mine with Cindy while listening to BBC Radio 4 comedy - the "<a href="http://www.ukuleleorchestra.com/">Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain</a>" playing Smells like Teen Spirit.  Very funny.</p>
<p>PM: J, R & I to university for Einstein Day, about Rockets.  Set off stomp rockets and water rockets, and watched a solid fuel rocket go up about 100m.  Displays about the planets and telescope (we brought home a make your own cardboard telescope) and two using liquid nitrogen to demonstrate super conductivity.  Fun.<br />
Toby put his remote control car back together - still not sure if it works though.</p>
<p>Evening:  Rose and I went for a walk in the twilight/dark - across the Millennium Bridge, up the other side of the river to Skeldergate Bridge and then home along Bishopthorpe Road.  Saw bats and had a good chat.</p>
