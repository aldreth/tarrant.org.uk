Last night we went to see [The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe][1] at
the West Yorkshire Playhouse with Lance and Mary.

It was brilliant, we all enjoyed it, and thought that it was even better
than last year\'s Christmas show. The staging was really good, with
fantastic revolving staircases, the children disappearing into the
wardrobe and reappearing through a line of huge white hanging coats
representing a snowy Narnia and Father Christmas and the White Witch
both having lovely sledges. Perhaps the \"sweetest\" bit was when spring
started, little red crocuses popped up through the stage!

The acting was also really good - particularly Lucy. And Aslan had a
fantastic lion costume.
