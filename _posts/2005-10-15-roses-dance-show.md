<p>Rose's dance show has been taking up a lot of time the last few weekends and I finally got to see the finished thing tonight.  I was amazed.  It was very good indeed and Rose looked very grown up in her various costumes (flower, sailor and spoon!)</p>
<p>Rose has got exhausted with the dress rehearsal last night, and then two performances today, so I hope she'll have a bit of a lie in tomorrow.</p>
