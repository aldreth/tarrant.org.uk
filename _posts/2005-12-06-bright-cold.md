I went for a run today along the river. It was a really crisp, bright
day. Two minutes after leaving our house, you can be beside the river;
and within about five minutes you can be running alongside trees and a
hedge through a field with sheep in it. It was a bit muddy today, but
not *too* slippery.

Also today, I\'ve had coffee with Michelle at the Blakeshead, and then
Ted popped in this afternoon on his way home after an early finish.
