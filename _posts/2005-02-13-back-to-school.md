<p>I'm back to school tomorrow.  I'm in for two and a half days this week, and am helping out and planning rather than being in charge - that starts next week.</p>
<p>I am apprehensive, but I think that it will be one of those situations that will be alright once it starts.  Definitely better to be getting stuck in than carrying on worrying.</p>
<p>Also - there are only five weeks till the end of term, and I'm not doing a full week till the last week of term.  So I hope I'll be sorted and settled by then.  Huge summer term to slog through - but worrying about that can wait.</p>
<p>I probably won't update this as often now I'll have "proper" things to do - but will try to keep it at least weekly.</p>
