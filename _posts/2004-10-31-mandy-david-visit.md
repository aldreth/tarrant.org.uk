<p>We've had Mandy, David, Amy and Tom to visit for the last few days.  They came up on Thursday and are leaving on Sunday.</p>
<p>We've had a really good time, and have done a lot of things together.  Toby, David, Tom and I visited <a href="http://www.aerialextreme.co.uk/">Aerial Extreme</a> to pretend to be monkeys. And then fish and chips on the way home.  Cindy, Mandy, Amy, John and Rose went off to do some shopping.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, all the adults went out for a meal at La Piazza and had a really lovely time - see photo.</p>
