We\'ve had Mandy, David, Amy and Tom to visit for the last few days.
They came up on Thursday and are leaving on Sunday.

We\'ve had a really good time, and have done a lot of things together.
Toby, David, Tom and I visited [Aerial Extreme][1] to pretend to be
monkeys. And then fish and chips on the way home. Cindy, Mandy, Amy,
John and Rose went off to do some shopping.

On Saturday morning, all the adults went out for a meal at La Piazza and
had a really lovely time - see photo.
