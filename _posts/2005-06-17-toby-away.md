Toby is away this weekend with school for his second Duke of Edinburgh
\"expedition\" - more like a week of walking really!

He\'s a bit tired out, because he only came back on Tuesday from a very
busy 6 days in Germany, visiting Tobi his german exchange partner.

Rose is out tonight on a sleepover, so John, Cindy and I are going to
the cinema. We\'re going to see [Batman][1] [Begins][2] - it\'s the only
film that isn\'t a 12 that\'s on!
