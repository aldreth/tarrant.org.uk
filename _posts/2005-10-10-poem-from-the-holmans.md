    Edward,

    What a lovely poem.

    When we are next up, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know where Cindy's ashes were scattered.

    Regards,

    Phil...

    Edward,

    If you are serious about the Trowbrige music festival then their site gives the dates: www.trowbridgefestival.co.uk.

    Roll on next Summer.

<p>This poem is one that the Holmans chose to read at Cindy's funeral, but didn't find a space to.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dead</p>
<p>The dead are always looking down on us, they say,<br />
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,<br />
they are looking down through glass-bottom boats of heaven<br />
as they row themselves slowly through eternity.</p>
<p>They watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth,<br />
and when we lie down in a field or on a couch,<br />
drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon,<br />
they think we are looking back at them,</p>
<p>which makes them lift their oars and fall silent<br />
and wait, like parents for us to close our eyes.</p>
<p>Billy Collins
</p></blockquote>
