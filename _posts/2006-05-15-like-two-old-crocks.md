<p>Played badminton with Simon at lunch time today.  He'd cycled into a lamppost and had a very sore and stiff shoulder and, for some reason, I'd woken up with a stiff and aching back.  So we shuffled about the court and neither of us played very well.  Still fun though.</p>
<p>Toby was trying to coach me this morning - "What could you do to get better?"  I don't want to have to think about it, I just like playing (but if it meant I won more often...)</p>
