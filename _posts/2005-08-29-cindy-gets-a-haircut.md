<p>Just taken Cindy up to Brian's for a haircut.  Her hair has gradually grown, till now it looked a bit mad and wild.  Much better now, short still, but it looks deliberate!</p>
<p>She didn't get up today till 6ish - feeling very tired and breathless.</p>
<p>The rest of us walked round the city walls with Phil and Marcia and then went for pizzas at La Piazza.  P+M left at about 3.  Last visitors for a while - we should have a chance to settle down and sort our selves out a bit before school starts next week.  Lovely to see everyone, but a bit busy.</p>
