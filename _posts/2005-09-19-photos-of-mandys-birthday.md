I\'ve put up some photos from Mandy\'s birthday weekend here in York.
There are several of Cindy.

[![Mandy &
Cindy](https://tarrant.org.uk/d/42-3/mandy40.jpg?g2_GALLERYSID=e5e1dddb92e367838451623a9b041b95)][1]

There are also more photos added to the [Photos of Cindy][2] gallery.

I\'ve had a busy day doing forms for probate, inheritance tax and
Cindy\'s pension. I also had to go to the supermarket and I met John
Rack for coffee this afternoon.

The children are tired, particularly Rose, after her weekend away.

I\'m tired too.
