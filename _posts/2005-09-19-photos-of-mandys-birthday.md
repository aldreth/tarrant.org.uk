<p>I've put up some photos from Mandy's birthday weekend here in York.  There are several of Cindy.</p>
<p><a href="https://tarrant.org.uk/v/mandy40/"><img src="https://tarrant.org.uk/d/42-3/mandy40.jpg?g2_GALLERYSID=e5e1dddb92e367838451623a9b041b95" alt="Mandy & Cindy" /></a></p>
<p>There are also more photos added to the <a href="https://www.tarrant.org.uk/v/cindyphotos">Photos of Cindy</a> gallery.</p>
<p>I've had a busy day doing forms for probate, inheritance tax and Cindy's pension.  I also had to go to the supermarket and I met John Rack for coffee this afternoon.</p>
<p>The children are tired, particularly Rose, after her weekend away.</p>
<p>I'm tired too.</p>
