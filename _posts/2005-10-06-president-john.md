John was elected onto the school council a couple of weeks ago - a boy
and each girl get chosen by each class. Today they had their first
meeting and John was selected to be President. It was a very close run
thing, he only won by one vote. Tomorrow the world!

I had lunch today with Cathy. It was great to sit and chat with her.
