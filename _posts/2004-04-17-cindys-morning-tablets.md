I thought it would be amusing to show a picture of all the tablets that
Cindy takes each morning!

<wpg2>tablets</wpg2>

The blue one is Echinacea - 400mg.  
 The red smarty sized one is a boots multivitamin, mineral and iron,  
 The yellow one is a high dosage multi vitamin B supplement with 39mg
B1, 50mg B2, 50mg B3, 41mg B6, 400micrograms Folic Acid, 50micrograms
B12, 0.05mg Biotin, 50mg Pantothenic Acid, 50mg Choline Bitartrate, 50mg
Inosoitol and 50mg PABA (whatever that is).  
 The yellowy liquid capsule is vitamin E - 268mg.  
 The speckled white one is Beta Carotene - 15mg.  
 The 4 little red ones are Prednisolone - a steroid. Each is 5mg.  
 The two white ones are Pyridoxine - very high dose of B6. Each tablet
is 50mg. This is to treat the sore, red, cracked hands she gets as one
of the side effects.  
 The white powder is Calcium Ascorbate crystals, that get dissolved in
her daily orange juice as a vitamin C boost. Each half spoonful has 2g
vitamin C.  
 She normally has a 1000mg Fish Oil capsule - but they\'ve run out at
the moment.  
 The purple liquid in the drinking glass is another multivitamin and
mineral with lots of micro minerals, that Cindy is trying out at the
moment.

Does this lot give her anything other than expensive urine? Who knows.

She also has Eprex - a weekly injection to boost blood production, 4
daily doses of Salbutamol and Ipratropium by nebuliser, and not
forgetting the constant pump of chemo, and visits to hospital each three
weeks for the other lot of chemo.

To counterbalance all these drugs, she has monthly visits to Diane the
reflexologist, and to Robert Maida for Reiki.
