<p>I thought it would be amusing to show a picture of all the tablets that Cindy takes each morning!</p>
<p><wpg2>tablets</wpg2></p>
<p>The blue one is Echinacea - 400mg.<br />
The red smarty sized one is a boots multivitamin, mineral and iron,<br />
The yellow one is a high dosage multi vitamin B supplement with 39mg B1, 50mg B2, 50mg B3, 41mg B6, 400micrograms Folic Acid, 50micrograms B12, 0.05mg Biotin, 50mg Pantothenic Acid, 50mg Choline Bitartrate, 50mg Inosoitol and 50mg PABA (whatever that is).<br />
The yellowy liquid capsule is vitamin E - 268mg.<br />
The speckled white one is Beta Carotene - 15mg.<br />
The 4 little red ones are Prednisolone - a steroid.  Each is 5mg.<br />
The two white ones are Pyridoxine - very high dose of B6.  Each tablet is 50mg.  This is to treat the sore, red, cracked hands she gets as one of the side effects.<br />
The white powder is Calcium Ascorbate crystals, that get dissolved in her daily orange juice as a vitamin C boost.  Each half spoonful has 2g vitamin C.<br />
She normally has a 1000mg Fish Oil capsule - but they've run out at the moment.<br />
The purple liquid in the drinking glass is another multivitamin and mineral with lots of micro minerals, that Cindy is trying out at the moment.</p>
<p>Does this lot give her anything other than expensive urine?  Who knows.</p>
<p>She also has Eprex - a weekly injection to boost blood production, 4 daily doses of Salbutamol and Ipratropium by nebuliser, and not forgetting the constant pump of chemo, and visits to hospital each three weeks for the other lot of chemo.</p>
<p>To counterbalance all these drugs, she has monthly visits to Diane the reflexologist, and to Robert Maida for Reiki.</p>
