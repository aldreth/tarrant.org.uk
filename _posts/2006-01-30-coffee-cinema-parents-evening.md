<p>I had coffee this morning with Mark and Michelle - nice to see them at the same time!</p>
<p>After lunch I went to the cinema to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/">Brokeback Mountain</a> - in the afternoon, all by myself.&nbsp; Wonderfully decadent.&nbsp; It always seems strange coming out of the cinema into daylight.&nbsp; Great film, beautiful scenery, very touching love story.</p>
<p>It was Toby's parents' evening today.&nbsp; What a star he is - his (in fact all three children's) parents' evenings are always very straightforward.&nbsp; Lovely to have people telling me such nice things about Toby!</p>
