<p>Rose is doing the Race for Life in aid of <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a>.  It's a 5km run around the Knavesmire on June 27<sup>th</sup>.  Quite a lot of her friends are doing the run too, so it should be fun.</p>
<p>You can sponsor her online <a href="https://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/RoseAndrews2007">here</a>.</p>
