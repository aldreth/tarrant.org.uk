<p>Phil and Marcia are visiting (with Claudia and Lucas) and we've just finished playing cards - just like when they used to live in Yarm and we were in Acomb.  We've also been eating <a href="http://www.bettysandtaylors.co.uk">Betty</a>'s cake and drinking Betty's coffee - what we did <em>back then</em>!  More children now though.</p>
<p>Rose, Claudia, Phil and I went on a <a href="http://endpapers.seventyfour.co.uk/publicationsBook.asp?pub_id_PK=15">Breadcrumbs</a> trail earlier today, while John, Lucas and Marcia went to the <a href="http://www.nrm.org.uk/html/home_pb/menu.asp">NRM</a>.</p>
<p>During the late afternoon, we got over excited to the point of barely being able to watch the tv - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4192314.stm">exciting finish</a> to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4192224.stm">4th Test</a>.</p>
<p>Cindy has been very tired and achy today, she got up around lunch time, and had to go back to bed before supper, and hasn't eaten properly this evening.</p>
