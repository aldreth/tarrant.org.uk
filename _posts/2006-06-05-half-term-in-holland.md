Over half term we went to one of the Center Parcs in Holland. We drove
via the Eurotunnel, then stopped at Antwerp on the way there and Bruges
on the way back. All together I drove 1015 miles!! A bit too much
really.

Once we were there though we had a great time. There was a big
\"tropical\" swimming pool, with slides and waves and bubble pools and
so on, where we spent most of our time. We also went climbing, played
badminton and bowling and played a couple of board games. We had most of
our meals out, and on one evening cooked a huge indoor barbeque.

We\'d rented bikes - traditional Dutch one gear, back pedal brake, sit
up and beg things they were. There were no cars allowed on the site
except on leaving and arriving days, so we could all cycle round without
worrying about bumping into anything.

It was great spending time with Will, Sarah, Jack and Grace,
particularly as they are leaving for Australia in September.

The stop in Bruges on the way home was fantastic. Will had found an
amazingly central hotel, we had a nice Italian meal and spent the lovely
warm evening wandering around the beautiful city. There seemed to be
loads to do there, lots of galleries and museums, and it would be a good
place to go back to. You can get there easily via Eurostar, so maybe
some weekend...
