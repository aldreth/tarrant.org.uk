<p>John and I went to see <a href="https://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/pages/02f.html">Stories in Red</a> the current Phoenix Dance production at the WYP last night.  John has gone a couple of times before, but with Cindy, so I've never seen them before.</p>
<p>It was quite strange, and very gripping.  Some of the dances didn't have much of what I would think of as "dancing" in them, but that is probably just my ignorance!  We saw Jeanetta, who used to teach John dance, and John would like to go back, as long as Isaac will go too.  That's a result in itself.</p>
