<p>Yesterday I taught Luigi and Clara - for the first time this week as they've been in Italy.  I had lunch with my dad and then went off to play badminton with Mark.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a school using all the badminton courts, so we ended up playing squash and as I'm no good at squash he beat me. Pah!</p>
<p>John went to Youth Theatre Yorkshire at the Theatre Royal in the evening. Another new activity for a new year.  It was his third session, and he really enjoyed it again.  They're doing things related to <a href="http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/cgi/events/events.cgi?t=template&amp;a=197">Sing Yer Hearts Out for the Lads</a> so it was all football chants last night.</p>
<p>I was worn out so went to bed early.</p>
