Got back from Yarmouth last night after an exhausting journey, but
having had a great time. The first train journey took 6 hours due to
flooding on the tracks so we didn\'t get in until 7. Had a good first
night with me and Josh cooking Pizza with a chocolate pudding and then
we went out for a midnight walk along the beach.

The second day was a bit cloudy, but we walked down the beach and went
on some of the amusements. Had fish and chips on the pier and went in
some of the tacky shops! That used up most of the day. Katie and Jenny
cooked tea that evening and then we had a party with some other people
staying who had also just finished their GCSEs.

On Wednesday we went down to the beach and it was very sunny. We went in
the sea and on Josh\'s inflatable whale which I bought him for his
birthday. Found this lovely cafe on the seafront and bought a toasted
teacake, soup and a bread roll for Â£3 - great value. Got all dressed up
and went out for a lovely curry in the evening.

On the final morning we had sausages for breakfast and went for a last
walk along the beach, whilst getting ice cream. Had to rush to get the
train, but made it in time. Journey took four hours so was still an hour
slow, but not too bad. Had a great time and I\'ll post some pictures
when I get them in a bit.

Rose\'s Race for life has been delayed until July due to rain - so
there\'s still time to sponsor her if you haven\'t yet! Hope everyone\'s
ok. Bye
