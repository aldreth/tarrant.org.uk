<p>I heard the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00093UQJS/qid=1133374461/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-3124275-6113239">JCB song</a> on the radio for the first time today.  John and Rose have been watching its fantastic <a href="http://www.jcbsong.co.uk/jcbvideo.asp">video</a> on the net for a while, ever since Sam Ballard showed it to them before the summer holiday.</p>
<p>It's quite touching and fun.  There's even talk of it being Christmas number 1.</p>
