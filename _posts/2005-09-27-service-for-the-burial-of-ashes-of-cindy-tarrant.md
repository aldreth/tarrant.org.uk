    Thank you for this Edward - I felt I could share in the service by having all these beautiful words given in such detail. I will visit her grave with flowers (when I know where it is) and remember her with joy as well as sadness. Her spirit shines on as an inspiration to us all.

    Love Alison

<p>Held at York Cemetery on<br />
Tuesday 27th September 2005</p>
<p><strong>A       Intro :-</strong>   We are met as a family to say our final farewell to Cindy Tarrant and to commit her ashes to be buried.</p>
<p>"Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted."</p>
<p><strong>B      A short period of silence to remember Cindy</strong></p>
<p><strong>C     Readings, recollections, memories - by the family</strong></p>
<p><em>1 Corinthians 15. 51-57 -  Read by Mandy</em></p>
<p>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."<br />
"O Death, where is your sting?<br />
O Hades, where is your victory?"</p>
<p>The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>"Remember Me" by  Christina Rossetti - Read by Jayne</em></p>
<p>Remember me when I am gone away,<br />
Gone far away into the silent land;<br />
When you can no more hold me by the hand,<br />
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.<br />
Remember me when no more day by day<br />
You tell me of our future that you plann'd:<br />
Only remember me; you understand<br />
It will be late to counsel then or pray.<br />
Yet if you should forget me for a while<br />
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br />
For if the darkness and corruption leave<br />
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br />
Better by far you should forget and smile<br />
Than that you should remember and be sad.</p>
<p><em>From "Having a Good Time.  Thoughts about my family and other things." One of Cindy's diaries - Read by Edward</em></p>
<p>Certainly if there is life after death I am going to be a runner and I will run every day because I can.</p>
<p><strong>D     Committal</strong>       Since the earthly life of Cindy Tarrant has come to an end we commit                        her ashes to be buried, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, trusting in the infinite mercy of God. May she rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>             Soil into grave</strong></p>
<p><strong>E      Short period of silence</strong></p>
<p><strong>F     Prayer</strong><br />
God of Love<br />
    who brought us to birth<br />
    and in whose arms we die:<br />
    in our grief and loss<br />
    give us hope<br />
    and embrace us with your love;<br />
    through Jesus Christ.  Amen</p>
<p>Father of all, we pray to you for those we love, but see no longer.  Grant them peace, let light perpetual shine upon them, and in  your loving wisdom work in them the good purpose of your perfect will.  Amen.</p>
<p><strong>G      Closing words</strong></p>
<p>Help us in the face of the mystery of death to turn towards the future that Cindy's<br />
energy for other people<br />
                        inspiration as a teacher<br />
                               joy for life<br />
                                  and love for her friends and family<br />
    may live on in our lives</p>
<p>and at the end may we face death with the same courage that she showed.</p>
<p>++++++</p>
<p>"May the souls of the faithful, by the mercy of God, rest in peace."</p>
<p>+++++++</p>
