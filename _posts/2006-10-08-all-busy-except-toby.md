<p>Toby had his first weekend lie in for ages as the paper shop has now shut, so he's unemployed.&nbsp; He's hoping to get a job in the bike shop where he did his work experience soon, which would make his Saturday's less leisured than today's was.</p>
<p>I cycled with John over to Canon Lee for his dancing, and then went into town for coffee.&nbsp; Rose had Lily over to play during the afternoon - they made burnt chocolate buns!&nbsp; We had delicious mussels for tea.</p>
<p>John went to Tom's for a birthday sleepover and I left Rose and Toby "home alone" while I went to the theatre with Sam to see <a href="http://wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=514">How Many Miles to Basra?</a>&nbsp; It was very thought provoking - quite heavy and political.<a href="http://wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=514"><br />
