<p>We seem to have got into a routine of all watching What Not to Wear every Wednesday evening, even though it goes on too late for a school night!</p>
<p>We all love laughing at the terrible "before" parts, and marvelling at the transformation at the end of each show.  I realise that I don't have a leg to stand on in the fashion stakes, but it's still funny.  As these reality tv makeover shows go it isn't too bad, and sometimes the changes in people's self-confidence, like last night,  is astonishing.</p>
