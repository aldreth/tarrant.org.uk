<p>We've had a lovely lunch today with Lance and Mary.  Roast Lamb - we haven't had anything roasted for a while (except for chicken on Friday, Cindy has just pointed out)!</p>
<p>Last night we had a fantastic meal with Lal and Pauline at Melton's.</p>
<p>Kitchen paint colour is chosen and bought.  All ready to go, just going to give the plaster another day to dry some more.</p>
