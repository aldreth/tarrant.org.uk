<p>I've really got out of the habit of writing here - partly because it felt as though I was trying to say the same things in different ways all the time!</p>
<p>Anyway - I'll start again and see how I go this time round.We had a good summer holiday, visiting Mandy and David, going to Wales with all the extended family and going to Florence with Helen and David.</p>
<p>John has started secondary school at Millthorpe, Rose is in year 6 at Scarcroft with a new male teacher (who was on my PGCE course) whom she really likes, and Toby is working hard in year 11.</p>
<p>I'm doing some tutoring of Clara and Luigi, who's mother has taken them out of school.</p>
<p>Over the summer I managed to do some yoga most days, and am still trying to keep that going.  <a href="http://www.yogayork.com/">Rob</a> has stopped doing daytime classes which is a shame, so I've started going to an evening class - longer and more difficult, but good.  I feel a lot better for doing a little each day.</p>
<p>I've been out a lot to the theatre - notably recently to <a href="http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/cgi/events/events.cgi?t=template&a=196">The Man with Two Gaffers</a> with Judy and Keith, <a href="http://wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=513">To Kill a Mockingbird</a> with Toby and <a href="http://wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=528">A One Man Star Wars Trilogy</a> with Mark.  Also still having coffe or lunch with friends - many thanks to Mark, Cathy, Kath, Andrea and Michelle.  Still playing badminton whenever possible with Mark and Simon.</p>
<p>Life is busy and generally fun!</p>
