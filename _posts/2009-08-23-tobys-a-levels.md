<p>Hooray!!</p>
<p>Toby got his A level results last Thursday.  He got an A for Geography, B for Biology and B for Chemistry.  It was a grade lower than Sheffield University had offered him for medicine, but they decided to have him anyway!</p>
<p>Hooray!!  Toby's going to medical school.</p>
<p>He's decided (in the last couple of weeks, while the rest of us have been away) to have a gap year, so at some point soon he'll be off round the world.  He doesn't know where he's going yet, but definitely hopes to have Christmas in Australia with Will and Sarah &ndash; on the beach no doubt.</p>
<p>Amazingly proud of him of course.  Well done for all the hard work Toby.</p>
