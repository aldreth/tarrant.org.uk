I\'ve dropped Toby off this morning at the [Sheffield Ski Village][1]
where he\'s going to take part in a learn to ski in a weekend course. 
One his Christmas presents.

Pauline\'s picking him up this afternoon and then he\'s staying with her
and Lal, and she\'ll take him back tomorrow morning for the second part
of the course.  I expect they\'ll have a curry tonight and generally
give Toby a good time.
