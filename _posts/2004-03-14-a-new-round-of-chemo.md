<p>Early this year Cindy had a routine scan to see how she was doing.  Unfortunately it showed that the tumours had grown, and Dr Bottomley recommended that she started back on chemo.</p>
<p>It is the same type of regime as before, with (generally) one night in hospital every three weeks, and the other drug pumping in constantly through a central line.</p>
<p>She went into hospital in early February to have the line put back in and have her first lot of treatment.  All went amazingly well, and she was back at home on Friday, having gone in on the Tuesday.  She recovered from this first treatment extraordinarily well - which was good, because I started full-time work at Wheldrake Primary towards the end of February.</p>
