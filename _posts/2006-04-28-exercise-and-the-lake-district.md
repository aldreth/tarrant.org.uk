<p>I had a busy day today.  I spent the morning sorting out packing for the Meeting trip to the Lake District - following a day of cooking yesterday (1 huge lasagna and a bread and butter pudding to take with us, and a hotpot for tea).  We're staying in quite basic accomodation, so we need to take sleeping bags as well as all the normal stuff.  And as it's the Lake District, I'm making sure the children have about 5 changes of clothes, just in case!</p>
<p>At lunchtime, I went to my normal yoga class, which is always exhausting and sweaty.  <strong>Then</strong> I went to the RI to play squash with Mark - even more exhausting and sweaty!  I used to think I got hot playing badminton, but it really doesn't compare with squash.</p>
<p>We left for the Lakes at about 5:30 and had a good journey, except for the last 3 miles, when we drove round the village about 4 times trying to find the right way.  We are staying at a place called Rookhow, which was built as a Monthly Meeting House.  What used to be the stable block has been converted into a hostel.  Also staying here are most of the other families who've come on the weekend, with Ruth and David Corry, and Nan.  Other people are staying at <a href="https://www.swarthmoorhall.co.uk">Swarthmore Hall</a>, which is rather more plush apparently.</p>
