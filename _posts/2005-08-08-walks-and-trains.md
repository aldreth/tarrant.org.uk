<p>Will, Toby, John, Rose and I set off on the Snowdon Horseshoe; Jane, Andy and Mary went on the PYG and Miners trail to Snowdon; the rest wanted to go on the train to the top.  There were vague plans to try and meet at the top.</p>
<p>The train was booked up until 5pm, so they went on a different train around a lake.  John's sunburn was really bad, so he, Rose and I went down to a lake and waited till Will and Toby came down the hill.  Toby walked Will into the ground apparently, limitless teenage energy!  Mary, Jane and Andy did their walk as planned.</p>
