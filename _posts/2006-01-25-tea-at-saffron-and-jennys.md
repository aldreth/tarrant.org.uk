<p>We've been out for tea tonight at Saffron, Jenny and Nok's - except for Toby, who cooked for himself.</p>
<p>In spite of their protestations that they couldn't cook reliably, they made a super chinese meal with three separate dishes. &Acirc; They are vegetarian, so it made John and Rose be a little more adventurous in what they tried.&Acirc; Jenny had made a delicious cake and everyone helped make the butter icing.</p>
<p>After tea we played a game of <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1111">Taboo</a> - Andrews vs Walklings.&nbsp; Ha ha, we won!</p>
