We\'ve been out for tea tonight at Saffron, Jenny and Nok\'s - except
for Toby, who cooked for himself.

In spite of their protestations that they couldn\'t cook reliably, they
made a super chinese meal with three separate dishes. Â They are
vegetarian, so it made John and Rose be a little more adventurous in
what they tried.Â Jenny had made a delicious cake and everyone helped
make the butter icing.

After tea we played a game of [Taboo][1] - Andrews vs Walklings.  Ha ha,
we won!
