<p>I went into school this morning to talk about starting back after the half term holiday.  They've arranged a "phased return" to work, where I observe and work with small groups during the first week back, gradually do more teaching during the second week, teach 3 days in the third week, 4 days in the forth, and the whole week in the fifth week, which is the last week of term.</p>
<p>I was remarkably worked up just going into school, but of course it was fine, everyone was very nice.  I went into my classroom to see my class, and they were pleased to see me, which made me feel great.  There are a lot of nice children in the class and I should be able to get back into enjoying teaching, rather than struggling to get through it.  I've arranged to go in a couple more times before the holiday, just as a helper or to pop in and that'll also start making it seem more normal.  I was surprised to discover how much I enjoyed seeing everyone!</p>
<p>The school have also found a behaviour management course, specifically for <abbr title="Newly Qualified Teacher">NQT</abbr>s  that I'm going to go on.  It's three or four days long scattered through the next term or so.</p>
<p>I'm actually starting to look forward to going back (some of the time!)</p>
