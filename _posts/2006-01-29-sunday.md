<p>I went to Meeting this morning with Rose, while John had a leisurely morning.  Lily came home with us to play with Rose.</p>
<p>Lal and Pauline brought Toby home, they had taken some photos of Toby skiing.</p>
<div class="g2image_centered"><wpg2>skiing/</wpg2></div>
<p>He had had a fantastic time and had only fallen over a few times.  He's only got one visible scrape, on his chin.&nbsp; Predictably enough he learnt very quickly and was one of the better pupils in the group.</p>
<p>We've had lovely roast lamb for tea and now everyone is going to bed.</p>
