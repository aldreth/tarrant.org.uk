A lovely Christmas.

Children all pleased with their presents, at one point on Christmas
morning our front room was ankle deep in discarded wrapping paper. Rose
almost immediately started on craft activities, Toby was handing out
everyone\'s presents, so was deliberately the last person to finish
opening his own, John was busy taking photos with the new camera that he
got for his birthday.

Lance came out of hospital on Christmas morning, which was slightly
earlier than expected. He seems to be doing really well.

We had a lovely Christmas meal in the afternoon, turkey etc.

Boxing Day we went round to Lance and Mary\'s and saw Will, Sarah, Jack
and Grace and opened more presents!

On Monday we did a walk (Mary, Will, Jack in his pushchair, Toby, John
and I). It was absolutely freezing, but good to be out. Rose and Cindy
got on with her felt making from a kit that John had given her.

Tuesday - sales. John in particular had lots of money - because he
hadn\'t spent birthday money. He bought books, blue peter annual, harry
potter game. Rose bought books and new trousers.  
 Toby finally got his car to start, but when we took it down to the
Knavesmire, it stalled each time it started moving. He\'s gone on an
internet forum - it seems the \"mixture\" is too \"rich\" and he needs
to adjust the carburettor - I feel really ignorant!

Wednesday - very lazy so far. Party later on this evening at David and
Anita\'s.
