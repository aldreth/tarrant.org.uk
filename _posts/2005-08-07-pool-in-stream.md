<p>We walked down to the stream in the grounds and found a waterfall with a fantastic pool at the bottom of it.  The pool is deeper than I am tall; big enough to jump and dive into, and have a swim of about 3 strokes across and 10 strokes round.  Rose was first into the water, as she slipped, then John and I went in.</p>
<p>Water was <strong>freezing</strong>!</p>
