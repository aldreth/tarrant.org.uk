<p>Toby is feeling rather agrieved this morning, as the papershop where he has diligently and very reliably done a paper round for the last 2 years has changed hands (again - that's twice since Christmas) and are stopping deliving papers.  From next Monday.  So he'll be out of a job.  I expect that for a short while the lie in will nice, but it'll soon be out weighed by the lack of money.</p>
<p>It seems very short sighted of the shop - they can't expect to sell all the papers that they deliver at the moment.  Surely not everyone will get up, get a paper, and then go home to read it?</p>
<p>Actually I am fired as of today - that's zero days notice! Oh well I find a new job soon</p>
