<p>It was raining this morning, after lovely weather for the rest of the weekend, so we left by about 9:30 after packing and tidying. Before leaving the village we went to see Arthur Ransome's grave, which was in the village churchyard.</p>
<p>Toby had lots of course work to do, which was another reason for leaving early. I cooked a big pasta sauce, because we'd invited all the Holmans and all the Cadbury Parkers around to have tea and watch <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074fm7">Doctor Who</a>. Much enjoyed by all (except Cathy - who thinks it's all nonsense!)</p>
