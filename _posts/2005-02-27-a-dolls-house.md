Very good. Felt long and lots of talking, but the main actor - Tanya
Moodie - who was on stage for almost all the play was absolutely

- very bleak ending. The play is all about the position of women in
19<sup>th</sup>/20<sup>th</sup> century society and coincidently we\'ve
just been listening to A Room with a View in the car and it has lots of
the same themes - independence, thinking for one\'s self...

There\'s a Guardian review of A Doll\'s House [here][1].
