<p>I've just got back from driving over to Immingham, the port on the other side of the Humber from Hull, to pick up a <a href="https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=19168&amp;item=5943721911&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW">monster truck</a> that Toby's bought off ebay.  It's huge, expensive and he's very excited about it.  It's about 3 months of saving his paper round money.  Apparently fuel is &Acirc;&pound;7 a litre!!</p>
<p>I've never been over the Humber Bridge before, so there was another excitement on the trip.</p>
<p>No doubt we'll fit in a drive at some point tomorrow.</p>
