<p>We've just got back from a lovely holiday in Patara, Turkey.</p>
<p>The hotel was pretty luxurious, and was run by two lovely people, Anne Louise and Muzaffer.  Muzaffer was a fascinating person, when he was growing up his family was still nomadic, and he was full of information about the region and its history.</p>
<p>We spent most of our time on the beach, but we did visit some ruins, go on a boat trip, visit a couple of the local towns and play a lot of card games.  It was very sunny for most of the time, but it did rain for a couple of days, and was grey on a couple of others.  We've all come home very brown, and feeling rested.</p>
