<p>We went over to Lal and Pauline's today.  Last year they had fantastic weather, but unfortunately it was grey and drizzly today.  Still a lovely afternoon though.  They'd got a bouncy castle for the children to play on, and even though it was damp and cold, Toby, John and Rose all enjoyed it.  Toby as enjoyed making very knowledgeable comments while watching the FA cup.</p>
