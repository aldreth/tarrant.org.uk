<p>We <b>all</b> (Jayne, Steve, Christopher, Pat, Maurice, Mandy, David, Amy, Tom, Cindy, Me, Toby, John and Rose - Matthew AWOL) went out for Jayne's birthday last night to a very nice Italian restaraunt in Emsworth called Niccolino's.  David had said that the portions were big, but they were truly enormous. Really wide menu, very good pizza.</p>
<p>We all had a really good time, especially when the waiter came round to help Steve sing to Jayne in Italian!</p>
