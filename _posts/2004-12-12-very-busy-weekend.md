**Friday:** At school, John and Rose went off to the station (with the
rest of the school) to wave flags at Prince Charles. It was very
exciting, apparently. He talked to both of them in groups and Rose even
answered one of his questions. At home, Isabel Wakeman dropped in for
coffee, I played badminton with Simon (lost, but it was very close and
an excellent game), Cindy went into town to get a bit more Christmas
shopping, we had a nice lunch together, I picked up the new curtains for
the back room and for Toby\'s room, Rose sang with the school choir at
McArthur Glen, then she went to trampolining and eventually it was time
for bed!

**Saturday:** Toby played rugby for school against All Saints and beat
them resoundingly, then went to Tom\'s for the rest of the day. Cindy,
John, Rose and I got the 9:25 train to Birmingham to watch the
Gymnastics World Cup Final. In spite of being called a World Cup Final,
it can\'t have been a very important competition, because lots of the
big names that we saw at the Olympics weren\'t there. It was exciting
being at a proper competition though, and when British gymnasts were
involved you got some sort of idea of what the atmosphere must be like
at a big competition with lots of supporters for all the different
competitors. We saw the Men\'s floor, which was great, rings, women\'s
vault, men\'s pommel - I can\'t tell who is good or not in this event at
all, it all looks the same to the untutored eye, and the women\'s
asymmetric bars, with Beth Tweddle taking part. [Here][1] are the
results. We got a taxi back to the station because Cindy had found the
walk through town to the National Indoor Arena too much, and just as we
were getting in the taxi, John spotted two Brazilian gymnasts signing
autographs. One of them was the winner of the men\'s floor event, and
they were just out on the pavement going off to wherever! He got their
autographs, jumped in the taxi and we got the 4pm train home.  
 After fish and chips for tea, Cindy and I went off to Judith and
Martin\'s Christmas party for an hour.

**Sunday:** Cindy had a lie in while the rest of us went off to
[Meeting][2]. Toby went swimming with Link Group, then dashed home to
have lunch and go out and play football. I don\'t know where he gets the
energy from. After lunch Pauline and Lal dropped in with Christmas
pressies, and stayed for tea. Cindy made scones and swiss roll. John and
Rose have started making themselves felt stockings for Father Christmas
to fill. I hope they aren\'t too large! Fungus the Bogeyman is on the
telly. Bedtime soon.
