<p>John's Saturday morning dance group were part of the city's Dance Performance yesterday afternoon.  His group had prepared a dance based on Hilare Belloc's <a href="https://www.poetry-archive.com/b/matilda.html">Matilda</a> - a poem about a girl who told lies about fires and so ended up being burnt to death!  I really enjoyed his bit - the whole lot was thought up and choreographed by the children, with lots of help from Janetta no doubt.</p>
<p>As usual there were lots of other good dances from primary and secondary schools  from across York.  It's really interesting looking at the different range of types of dance and level of skill that's going on in schools</p>
