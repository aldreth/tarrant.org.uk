<p>Nothing particular during the day - a bit of tidying up, putting away the washing...  Toby went off to Monk's Cross with Tom and Josh, but didn't buy anything.</p>
<p>John and Rose went over to Tom and Anna's for a short time in the afternoon and I pushed Cindy into town and we had coffee in The Pantry - opposite Clifford's Tower.</p>
<p>In the evening we went and had supper at Lance and Mary's.  Their Danish friends Ole and Lillian are visiting.</p>
