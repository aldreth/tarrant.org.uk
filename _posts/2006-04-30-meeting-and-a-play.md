We went over to Swarthmore for Meeting this morning. The village Meeting
House had had a fire, so Meeting was held in the Hall itself. There were
about 10 people from the village, and about 40 from Friargate, almost
half of them children.

Lunch was amazing. Loads of different salads, quiches, lovely breads,
cheese...

We rehearsed the play after lunch. I must admit I quite enjoyed the
rehearsal (I was George Fox, John was Priest Lampitt (we had to argue)
and Rose was a servant). I did not enjoy the performance at all though,
and have decided just to say \"no\" if anyone asks me to be in a play
again.

More food in the evening, another much smaller bonfire, and then back to
Rookhow.
