<p>Cindy & I had organised this term's worth of big deal tickets.  I decided that I didn't want to go without her, so I've given them away to family and friends.</p>
<p>Sam and Steve went to see <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=464">Twelfth Night</a> (<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/reviews/story/0,,1577332,00.html">review</a>).</p>
<p>Mary and her sister Anne went to see <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=482">My Mother Said I Never Should</a> (Anne said it was <em>interesting</em>!).</p>
<p>Judy and Keith are going to see <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=478">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p>And Jo and Bill are going to see <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=472">Dead Funny</a>.</p>
