Cindy\'s fifth session of treatment in this round of chemo, which was
due tomorrow, has been postponed, probably for a week. This is because
she is \"still too toxic\"!

The main reasons are that her hands are so sore and she has bad mouth
ulcers. This should give her a chance to recover some more, to be at a
higher level of health before being knocked right back down by
treatment.

Quite a relief really.
