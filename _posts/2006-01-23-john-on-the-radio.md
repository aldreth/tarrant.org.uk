<p>The BBC rang up on Friday asking if John would do a report for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/bigtoe/">Big Toe</a>.  They had our phone number because he was on last year, when he did a report about Chinese New Year.&nbsp; They must be very short of reporters to be phoning around!</p>
<p>This time round he did a report on scuba diving, which he actually did a while ago, but he pretended that it was recent.&nbsp; A very good account, well written and well read.</p>
<p>You can listen to it for the next few days from the BBC Listen Again player.&nbsp; It was Saturday's Big Toe.</p>
