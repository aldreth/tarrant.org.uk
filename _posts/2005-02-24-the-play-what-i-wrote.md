<p>Cindy went to see <a href="https://www.theplaywhatiwrote.com/">The Play What I Wrote</a> with Judy Emerick and came home saying it was absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>So if you get a chance...</p>
<p>We're off on Friday to see <a href="https://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=437">A Dolls House</a> - I don't expect it will be quite as funny!</p>
