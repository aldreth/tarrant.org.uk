I just watched 4 music presents... Morrissey from earlier in the month.
He\'s aged really well and the new songs sound good. I bought the new
album for Toby for his birthday, so must make sure I get to listen to it
too.

Morrissey performed a Smiths song as well, Still Ill. The Smiths are
possibly the one band that most represent my late teenage years to me.
Their songs are instantly familiar and I still know a lot of the lyrics
by heart. Oh those evenings spent discussing the most hilariously
depressing lyrics!

> And if a double-decker bus  
>  Crashes into us  
>  To die by your side  
>  Is such a heavenly way to die  
>  And if a ten-ton truck  
>  Kills the both of us  
>  To die by your side  
>  Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine

Wonderful.
