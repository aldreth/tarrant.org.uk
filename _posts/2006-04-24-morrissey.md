<p>I just watched 4 music presents... Morrissey from earlier in the month.  He's aged really well and the new songs sound good.  I bought the new album for Toby for his birthday, so must make sure I get to listen to it too.</p>
<p>Morrissey performed a Smiths song as well, Still Ill.  The Smiths are possibly the one band that most represent my late teenage years to me.  Their songs are instantly familiar and I still know a lot of the lyrics by heart.  Oh those evenings spent discussing the most hilariously depressing lyrics!</p>
<blockquote><p>And if a double-decker bus<br />
Crashes into us<br />
To die by your side<br />
Is such a heavenly way to die<br />
And if a ten-ton truck<br />
Kills the both of us<br />
To die by your side<br />
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine</p></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
