After years of looking enviously at people who can swim front crawl
efficiently and smoothly, I\'ve decided to learn myself. So I\'ve
enrolled in a \"Swim for Fitness and Stroke Improvement\" class. I\'ve
just got back from it! It\'s from 9:20 till 10:00 - just a bit late
really. I think I\'m going to be starving in half an hour.

Not too bad - some very tiring crawl exercises; just legs, or arms or
legs and one arm... I wasn\'t too slow - I didn\'t feel I was in the
wrong class.

See how it goes for the rest of the term.
