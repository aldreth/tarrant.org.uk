Last night the first [Prom][1] of the year was Michael Tippett\'s A
Child of Our Time.

It\'s a piece I know quite well, having sung the spirituals as a treble
and the whole thing as a bass, and I\'ve always found it moving.

Last night though, it was wonderfully emotional. It seemed very
appropriate timing, with lots of resonances with the London bombing -
particularly the mother\'s plea for peace - [\"How many mothers\' hearts
shall be maimed?\"][2].

The last ten minutes or so of the piece turns from a mood of sorrow and
despair, to one of consolation and hope. As it ended with \"Deep
River\", one of the spirtuals, I was in tears, as I expect a lot of the
audience were.
