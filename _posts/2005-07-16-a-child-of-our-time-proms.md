<p>Last night the first <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/">Prom</a> of the year was Michael Tippett's A Child of Our Time.</p>
<p>It's a piece I know quite well, having sung the spirituals as a treble and the whole thing as a bass, and I've always found it moving.</p>
<p>Last night though, it was wonderfully emotional.  It seemed very appropriate timing, with lots of resonances with the London bombing - particularly the mother's plea for peace - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4671367.stm">"How many mothers' hearts shall be maimed?"</a>.</p>
<p>The last ten minutes or so of the piece turns from a mood of sorrow and despair, to one of consolation and hope.  As it ended with "Deep River", one of the spirtuals, I was in tears, as I expect a lot of the audience were.</p>
