<p>On Monday evening Rose and I went up to Millthorpe for their open evening.  It's very odd to think that next year I won't have any children at Scarcroft - for the first time in 11 years!  I'm already missing the morning school run, because Rose is walking to school by herself and next year I won't get the afternoon one either.  When on earth will I pick up all the gossip - or some days talk to anyone at all!</p>
<p>John was busy at school being a model pupil in a French class, which we went to watch.  We managed to avoid having to listen to the head's talk, which was a relief because he isn't the world's greatest speaker.  We vaguely wandered around looking at bits and pieces - fantastic art rooms - but I couldn't be bothered to think of any intelligent questions to ask pupils or teachers.  As Rose said when I asked her if she wanted to go and look around All Saints, "Not really, I'm going to go to Millthorpe, aren't I?"</p>
