A general sorting out day today. Several loads of washing dried and
sorted. Supermarket **not** visited, must do it tomorrow!

A good game of badminton with Simon at lunchtime. He beat me 2-1 in
spite of me being up by quite a lot in each game. Very frustrating the
way I let the games go.

Bookgroup at Simon\'s this evening. Discussing \"Heart of Darkness\",
which I found really hard to get through, didn\'t enjoy, and didn\'t
feel I understood. Nice to discover that most other people hadn\'t got
it either.
