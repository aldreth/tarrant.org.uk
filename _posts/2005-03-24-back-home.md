<p>We've been back at home since Friday evening, as my parents were having other guests (David and Rachel - Sarah's brother and wife, who are visiting Europe for a whistle-stop 4 weeks).</p>
<p>The floor is down, the plastering finished and today the coving is going up, so there are obvious improvements happening.  We ordered all the appliances last week, and they should be arriving soon.  David is coming next week to start decorating and kitchen fitting.  I've rented a dehumidifier to help the plaster and floor dry out quickly.</p>
<p>The house is still chaos, with nowhere to cook or eat really.  Fortunately the Sodens are away for a week and are letting us use their kitchen.  By next week we should be able to get back into the kitchen and use a tap, and possibly put up a camping stove.</p>
