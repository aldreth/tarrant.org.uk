<p>Sorry about the rubbish title, couldn't think of anything more inspiring as just posting about general life at the moment! Been about 4 months since I last posted -&nbsp; had a busy summer away in Greece, the lakes and now started college. Posted ages ago that I finished my GCSEs and got my results at the end of August, did very well and have my awards ceremony next week.</p>
<p>Rose has settled very well into Millthorpe&nbsp; enjoying it and did eventually run her race for life - raising a lot of money. John is in the school production of the Wizard of Oz and has been very busy in the evenings with lots of rehearsals.&nbsp; College is good very different from Millthorpe and I am enjoying it a lot more.</p>
<p>Everyone is out at the moment at Granny's (Mary's)&nbsp; ceremony as she is becoming a Lay Reader. Going out for a meal at Meltons tonight which will be very nice. Off out into town so I might post sometime soon or it might be in a few more months!</p>
