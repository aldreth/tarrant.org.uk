<p>Cindy's dad, Maurice, was 70 on Friday and we all met up for a surprise meal.  He knew he was going out with Mandy and David, but also there were Amy and Tom, Janyne, Steve, Christopher (who's 20<sup>th</sup> birthday it was), Matthew and Cindy and I.  Maurice was very surpirsed and very pleased!</p>
<p>Jayne had organised a fantastic gift for him.  It's a voucher for him to be able to drive a F1 racing car.  Maurice seemed pretty overwhelmed by this, and couldn't wait to be able to do it.  Photos to follow once he does it!</p>
<p>We had a nice meal in a pub near to where Pat and Maurice live - followed by coffee and more drinks back at their house.  Didn't get into bed intil almost 2!  Then drove back home this morning.</p>
