Toby slept from 7:30 yesterday evening till 8:30 this morning - I had to
phone the paper shop to say he wouldn\'t be in. He also had a bit more
sleep from about 9:30 to 11 this morning, but then he got up and had
something to eat. He ate his usual huge amount at tea today, so I think
he\'s getting back to normal. He had headaches, runny nose, sore throat
and a cough; but mainly he was just tired out and run down.

John went to an athletics thing at Millthorpe after school this
afternoon. He had a fantastic time, and the Scarcroft team came second.

Rose had Gemma to play after school. They got lots of embossing stuff
out in Rose\'s room, and then **put it away**. Shock, horror!
