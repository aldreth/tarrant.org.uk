<p>After what feels like an age of apply for jobs and not getting anywhere, I've got a job for next September at last!  It's full time, <b>permanent</b> and close to York - <a href="http://www.multimap.com/p/browse.cgi?local=h&scale=100000&pc=YO83SQ&title=Cawood+CE+Primary+School">Cawood</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is it a job, I think it's actually a good job.  It's quite a small village school, (info <a href="http://www.schoolsdirectory.com/details.asp?id=16042&type=0&gender=0&boarding=0&db=hcgaz&pc=YO8+3SQ&place=cawood">here</a>), 150 pupils and 5 teachers plus headteacher, teaching assistants, and so on.  It seemed like a very supportive school, with lots of community links.  It also had a good <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=summary&id=121625">Ofsted report</a> and looks good in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/03/school_tables/primary_schools/html/815_3355.stm">league tables</a> (for what that's worth).</p>
<p>Now all I've got to do is survive the rest of the term at my current job - I'm off tomorrow to the Lake District for three nights/four days with the class, which I'm dreading!</p>
