<p>We've just been to Arkengarthdale (in Swaledale - Yorkshire Dales) with David and Anita, friends from Meeting, and their two children - Jordan and Mimi.</p>
<p>We had an excellent time roaming on the moors, playing games (Great Game of Britain and Perudo), bird watching, stream damming and - particularly in the case of the boys - staying up very late.</p>
<p>Jordan and Mimi are strict vegetarians, but David and Anita seemed to enjoy having a sausage and a little bit of bacon!</p>
<p>The children did an Easter Egg hunt and had a large amount of chocolate each.</p>
