<p>Today we drove to the <a href="https://www.ysp.co.uk/view.asp?id=1">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>, which is near Wakefield.  It was a glorious day - hot and sunny.  We walked around parts of the park, saw some Henry Moores, Barbara Hepworths and a William Turnbull retrospective, part of which was in the new underground gallery.  Read the paper in the sunshine, had a nice lunch in the cafe and then came home.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
