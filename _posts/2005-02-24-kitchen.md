The kitchen ripping out is really getting close now. We\'ve got the new
units in Lance and Mary\'s cellar, the floor digging up people (damp)
are booked, and a plumber is booked to move the gas for the new hob.
Dave knows what we want and is coming up next week to start!!

We\'ve still got to order new oven and hob, but I think we\'ve decided
what we want and it only has a week or so delivery time, so we\'re
waiting a little bit still.

What we have got to do is empty the kitchen of all its stuff - and most
of the backroom too, so it doesn\'t get too filthy.
