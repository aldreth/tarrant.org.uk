<p>I had a great day today.  Immediately after dropping the children at school, I went to the station, met Ted and went over to Leeds for the day.</p>
<p>We spent the morning looking around the morning looking around the <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/artgallery/">art gallery</a>.  Unfortunately, the main part of the sculpture gallery was closed while they were setting up a new exhibition.  We looked at the pictures though - some Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Francis Bacon and Bridget Riley stick in my mind.  There was also a 6ft tall model for a 150ft tall brick man by Antony Gormley that never got built and a rather dubious video art installation.</p>
<p>Then we went for lunch at an Italian restaurant that was recommended by one of Chris's friends and ate and drank well!</p>
<p>Then back to York in time to pick up the kids - or rather go to a talk/show by Kjartan Poskitt plugging his new book - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439968607/qid=1101245802/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-5298652-7507623">The Magic of Pants</a>.  Kjartan did his usual amusing mix of maths tricks, magic and banter.</p>
<p>Toby cooked tea, John and Rose went to gym and are finally in bed (just) and I'm hoping to watch Teachers with Cindy soon.</p>
<p>Quite a contast to Cindy's day.</p>
