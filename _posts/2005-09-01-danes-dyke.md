<p>I went off today with the children to <a href="https://www.ukfossils.co.uk/sec034a.htm">Dane's Dyke</a> to look for fossils.  It's supposed to be good for fossils in the chalk, but we didn't find any.</p>
<p>We were going to go onto Hunmanby Gap, but just as we were packing the car to go, John unfortunately shut Rose's finger in the boot of the car and gave it a huge knock.  Luckily, it wasn't broken, but it hurt like mad, so after running it under a tap in the toilets and an ice cream,  we came straight home.</p>
<p>Cindy spent the day in bed, but Joolz came to see her this afternoon.  She's tired again - after the excitement of getting out of bed yesterday!</p>
