<p>Maurice used his birthday present today - a driving experience at <a href="http://www.thruxtonracing.co.uk/">Thruxton</a>.</p>
<p>He went round first in a Mazda RX8, first a passenger, then as a driver. Then he went round in a single seater racing style car.  He was really good and overtook a few other cars.</p>
<p>There were loads of amazing cars there that you could pay to have a drive in.  I was amazed by how interesting I found it!</p>
