<p>I've really got out of the habit of posting here, so I'm going to try and get going again.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Christmas much more than I expected to.  We had a very busy time - an excellent Christmas day at Lance & Mary's with all my side of the family.  Then we went down to Fareham to stay with Mandy and David and saw Pat & Maurice too.</p>
<p>We spent new year with James & Emma - the adults just about managed to stay awake, while Toby, John and Rose were full of energy.  Then we came home for a couple of days before the start of term.</p>
<p>There has been one whole week of school and a few days before that.  Everyone seems to have settled back into it alright.  John had a good work assembly this afternoon which was really good.  His class performed a version of Julius Caesar.  John was the soothsayer, and kept wandering around saying "Beware the ides of March."</p>
<p>Toby and I went to his award ceremony for the Duke of Edinburgh scheme this evening, so he now officially has his Bronze Award.&Acirc;&nbsp; He's just written the letter to apply to go on the Silver Award, so I hope he gets on to that.</p>
<p>I'm having a party on Sunday afternoon/evening, so if you're in the area drop in for a drink from 5pm!</p>
