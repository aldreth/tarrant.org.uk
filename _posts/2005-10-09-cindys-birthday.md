<p>Today would have been Cindy's 44<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>To celebrate we are going out this evening to La Piazza for a meal.</p>
<p>John, Rose and I have spent the afternoon at Beningbrough Hall with David, Mimi and Jocelyn Campbell.  Have climbed trees, run around, had scones and generally enjoyed ourselves.  Toby has been working very hard on his graphics project and then went out with Tom Robinson.</p>
