<p>I had coffee with Andrea this morning - two hours putting the world to rights.</p>
<p>Rose went for her third <a href="https://yogabunnies.co.uk/">yoga</a> session and really enjoyed it again.  We've been looking for a children's yoga class for a while and these have finally started up - and they're dead local.  She goes with Gemma and at the moment there are only the two of them in the class. They were doing handstands - definitely more than I can manage!</p>
