      Edward-
           I  read your last few postings and are relieved that Cindy  is feeling quite OK.  Also, regarding your recent visit to the Turkish  baths,  both Joyce and I went to a Turkish bath last year during our trip to Morocco.  You might recall that we have had a Finnish sauna at our house since 1972 and enjoy it very much and frquently.  In fact Gail, Linda and families will be down here for a vist  and final sauna before we move out of our house next  August.
      When we have sauna we regularly heat the hot room up to between 90C and 105C dpending on individual wishes.
         I enjoy, from time to time, reading your blogs.

[Scarcroft][1] - John and Rose\'s school ran an arts evening for parents
and children that we\'ve just got home from.

It started off with Mrs Cornhill, the headteacher, giving a ten minute
talk on how \"the arts\" (music, art, dance and drama) fit into the
curricullum. then there was the chance to take part in various
workshops. There was dance (no takers!), collage, art in ICT, drama,
textile painting and drumming - which we did.

Mrs Cornhill ran the drumming, with Mrs Ekers. It started off with some
rhythm copying and listening games. The main part of the session was
learning various drumming pattens and putting them together to make a
piece. We split into two groups and had the two groups doing their
different rhythms fitting together and **then** Mrs Cornhill put some
complicated rhythms on top of us. I really enjoyed it and I think
everyone else did too.

I was really impressed at how many teachers had stayed to take part in
the evening and what fun they seemed to be having. We\'re very lucky to
have such a good school on our doorstep.
