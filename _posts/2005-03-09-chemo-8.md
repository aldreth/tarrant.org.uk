Another chemo session on Tuesday (yesterday). Cindy has been very busy
today, including going to her Italian class, but has gone to bed
exhausted already. Side effects still not too bad - her hands are
getting red and sore and her nails are awful, but nothing major thank
goodness.

We\'re all getting used to the huge amount of space her at the Mount -
will we ever be satisfied in our little house again! Of course we will,
especially once we\'ve got a lovely new kitchen.

Cindy let in the builders this morning and already the plaster is off
the walls up to 1m from the floor, all the quarry tiles have been lifted
and the concrete underneath is starting to go. Mayhem.
