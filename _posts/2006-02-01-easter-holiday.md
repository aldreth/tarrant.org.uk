<p>Great excitement, as I've booked us a holiday in Turkey over Easter.  We're going to stay in a <a href="http://www.pataraviewpoint.com/">hotel</a> that David Campbell recommended, and fly from Gatwick to Dalaman.  It's just about on the beach, and in April Turkey should be pretty warm, so I expect we'll spend quite a lot of time not doing very much.  Then in the summer we're going to Florence with Helen and David.  So plenty of holidays this year.</p>
<p>It's been so cold today that it makes the idea of a warm holiday even more enticing.  I've been feeling a bit run down today, so didn't do anything but doze in a hot bath this afternoon.</p>
