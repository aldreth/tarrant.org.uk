<p>Yesterday evening, Cindy and I went to Gateshead to see <a href="https://www.nitinsawhney.com/">Nitin Sawhney</a> play at the <a href="https://www.thesagegateshead.org">Sage</a>.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic building and a brilliant concert hall.  It is very comfortable and has fantastic acoustics, but it was a slightly strange venue for a "pop" concert.</p>

<p>Because it was all seating, everyone was sitting down most of the time and listening very reverently with clapping after the end of each song - a concert rather than a gig.</p>
<p>The music was brilliant with 5 fantastic vocalists.  They played some tracks off the new album, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007D5654/qid=1115469571/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-0103637-0054040">Philtre</a>, and some older ones too.</p>
<p>We came home on the train after the concert and collapsed into bed at about 1am.</p>
