Yesterday evening, Cindy and I went to Gateshead to see [Nitin
Sawhney][1] play at the [Sage][2].

It\'s a fantastic building and a brilliant concert hall. It is very
comfortable and has fantastic acoustics, but it was a slightly strange
venue for a \"pop\" concert.

<wpg2>sage</wpg2>

Because it was all seating, everyone was sitting down most of the time
and listening very reverently with clapping after the end of each song -
a concert rather than a gig.

The music was brilliant with 5 fantastic vocalists. They played some
tracks off the new album, [Philtre][3], and some older ones too.

We came home on the train after the concert and collapsed into bed at
about 1am.
