<p>We've just got home from the last of our "Big Deal" tickets at the WYP.    It was an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/558">The 39 Steps</a> by <a href="https://www.johnbuchansociety.co.uk/">John Buchan</a>.</p>
<p>Acted by only 4 actors (and an extra arm at a crucial plot point!), it was very fast, funny, melodramatic and all round excellent entertainment.  Definitely the best thing we've seen in the season.  Highly recommended.</p>
<p>I got given the next season's "Big Deal" for my birthday, so more to look forward to in the Autumn.</p>
