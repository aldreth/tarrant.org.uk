We\'ve just got home from the last of our \"Big Deal\" tickets at the
WYP. It was an adaptation of [The 39 Steps][1] by [John Buchan][2].

Acted by only 4 actors (and an extra arm at a crucial plot point!), it
was very fast, funny, melodramatic and all round excellent
entertainment. Definitely the best thing we\'ve seen in the season.
Highly recommended.

I got given the next season\'s \"Big Deal\" for my birthday, so more to
look forward to in the Autumn.
