Late in the afternoon, Cindy came downstairs. I pushed her in the
wheelchair along the landing to the stairs and then gave her a piggy
back downstairs. After she\'d recovered, we went out for a walk along
the river.

We were also all able to eat tea together and watch a documentary film
about the sea ([Deep Blue][1]).

It really was great to have Cindy with us. She also says that it was a
relief to be out of the bedroom. She\'s getting a bit bored of the same
four walls!
