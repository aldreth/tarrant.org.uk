<p>John has been off school today with tummy bug, but he was well enough to go round <a href="https://www.millthorpeschool.co.uk">Millthorpe School</a> in preparation for moving up next year.</p>
<p>He recognised lots of the pupils who were there, which made him feel better the change - not that he seems worried.  All the pupils were very chatty and seemed well balanced enough!  I think it's really difficult to tell what a school is like from the outside though.  Toby seems to get on well there, so...</p>
<p>All Saints next week, but I should think it'll be Millthorpe for John and Rose - there will have to be very compelling reasons if not.</p>
