<p>Today I took John and Rose to see the 'Cat In The Hat' very medicore and given only 5 out of 10 by John. It has been a lovely day and we have all spent the day generally settling back home after our time in the Dales. Toby has a job trial doing a paper round and Edward has continued with completing job applications.</p>
