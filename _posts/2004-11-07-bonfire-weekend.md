We\'ve had a great weekend - **two** bonfire parties and visitors to
stay.

On Friday evening we went to John and Katie\'s house and then allotment
for a fantastic bonfire, lots of sparklers, red wine and port, then back
to theirs for pumpkin soup, bread, cakes and Rose\'s extra special
chocolate brownies. Unfortunately Cindy was too worn out by her
treatment to come to any of this - she sat on the sofa and dozed and
then went to bed early.

While we were at John & Katie\'s, Simon Palmour told me about his new
[blog][1].

Then on Saturday afternoon, Lal and Pauline came to stay, bringing a
lovely butter dish for Cindy\'s birthday. We went to Steve and Sam\'s
for another bonfire party - lots of fireworks set off by Tom, Josh, Toby
and even John lit a couple. We had soup, veggie burgers for the
children, quite a lot of red wine and a very pleasant evening. Cindy had
to go home about 9 o\'clock and was soon followed by all the others.
Once we got home, we were all feeling rather peckish, so we got a take
away curry.

Today, we all went to Meeting, while L&P cooked lamb for us. Toby missed
the meal, because he had to go and play football. Yet another loss for
the Panthers.
