<p>Went to Harlech beach - about a 20 minute drive. It's a lovely flat sandy beach, with views of Harlech Castle, the Llyn Peninsular and the Snowdonia hills behind it.  The sea was nice and warm - much warmer than the North Sea.</p>
<p>John got quite badly sunburnt unfortunately, due to not having his sun cream renewed often enough.</p>
