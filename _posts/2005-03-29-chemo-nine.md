Cindy was due to have another session of chemo this week, but as she\'s
still recovering from a cold, and frankly, because next week will be
much more convenient, she phoned the hospital this morning and told them
she would like to delay by a week. By then we\'ll all be back at
school/work and there will be less going on that she\'ll have to do when
she\'s feeling knackered.

Also, this will mean that she won\'t have a treatment in the week of
Jane\'s wedding, which will be nice.
