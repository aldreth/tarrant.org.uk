<p>We had  Jane & Andy and Steve & Sam with Tom and Josh round on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Cindy and I had spent the previous day and part of that day cooking curries.  We had lamb and spinach, tandoori chicken, black eyed beans with mushrooms, aubergine and tomato, green lentil dal and home made samosas.  All lovely!</p>
<p>All the children stayed up till midnight, even Rose.  In fact the adults seemed tireder than the children.  Toby, Tom and Josh would have stayed up for ages longer.</p>
