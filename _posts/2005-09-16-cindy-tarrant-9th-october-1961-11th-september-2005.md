    My best memories of Cindy are when she was pregnant with Toby when you came back to London - she was so excited and we used to get the baby book out every week to see how big he would be etc!!

    Cindy was a one off and a very good friend to many people. I have rarely met such a positive lovely person.

    I also remember your wedding with great fondness and the barn dance afterwards - great fun. Will try to find some Old Sarah Bonnell School photos to send.

  content: "Our memories of Cindy mostly involve laughing - whether lifting the mood
    of the everyday mundane tasks, or enjoying a glass of wine after a meal, we can
    still hear her laugh.\n\nTo say that Cindy was generous, engaging, funny and simply
    fantastic company is to state the obvious. \n\nFor us, Cindy always embodied what
    it is to be part of a loving family."

  content: "Just read Chris' memory about Cindy being pregnant with Toby ... I remember
    Joyce discussing with me what colour outfit to knit for the new arrival. She decided
    on pale green! We both had visions of Cindy with the new baby on the back of her
    bike!\n\nMy best memories however are of one mad summer when we decided to go
    running before school. I lived in Stratford and Cindy in East Ham. We met up in
    Plashet Park then ran back to Cindy's for a breakfast of stewed apple and natural
    yogurt (very healthy). \n\nO and one more wonderful moment, when I went to Heathrow
    to see Cindy and Karen off on their round the world trip ... they flew aeroflot.\n\nI
    miss her loads.\n\nChris, please get in touch if you read this!\n\n\nLove Jane\nxxxxxx\n\n"
