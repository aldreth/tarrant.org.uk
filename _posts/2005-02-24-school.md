<p>A lot to catch up as I haven't posted for a week.</p>
<p>My first week back at school was fine - lots of observation and group work.  The children seemed pleased to see me and I enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>The second week was up and down.  Monday was fine.  Tuesday morning was good, but Tuesday afternoon was dreadful.  I felt right back where I had been - then I stupidly stayed for a staff meeting and must have been obviously miserable.  Wednesday though, was really good.  I had an excellent science lesson that all the children enjoyed.  Andrew, the deputy head asked me to think about what I had done to make it better, but really I don't think I had done anything particularly different.  I was as well prepared on Tuesday as I was on Wednesday, and in fact Wednesday's lesson was what I'd tried to start on Tuesday.  So - good that I had a good lesson and I must try and stay positive through the bad ones.</p>
<p>Next week I'm in school on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - Thursday and Friday by myself.</p>
