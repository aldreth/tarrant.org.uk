<p>Ted and I went for a walk in <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?local=h&amp;scale=200000&amp;title=Farndale&amp;lon=-0.9681&amp;lat=54.3661&amp;icon=x">Farndale</a>, in the North York Moors, today.  We drove up there through Malton and Pickering after dropping children at their schools.  We started from between Hutton le Hole and Gillamoor, just near Barmoor where we used to go on Meeting family weekends, walked up the valley, up the hill side, and back.</p>
<p>The rain held off, except for a shower while we were eating lunch, until we got back to the car - when it started to pour.</p>
<p>On the way back home we went past the <a href="http://croptonbrewery.co.uk/">Cropton Brewery</a>, so we stopped for a quick half and some chips!</p>
