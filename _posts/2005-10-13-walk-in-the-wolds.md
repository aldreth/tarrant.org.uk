<p>I went for a <a href="http://www.outdooryorkshire.com/exec/137469/8519/PROFILE=NDpVS19VS1dFQjUxNDk3MzUwOlVLX1VLV0VCMjQ5OTM2MzE6RU5HTElTSDpHQjoxMTI5MjM1MjcxOjExMjkyMzUyNzY6Ojo=">walk</a> in the Yorkshire Wolds today with David Campbell.  We left after dropping children at schools and drove to Kirby Underdale.  It was about 8&frac12; miles round trip from there to Thixendale and back.  The weather was a bit grey and misty, but it didn't actually rain!  In Thixendale we looked at the building that used to be a youth hostel, that I stayed at with Will about 7 years ago.  It's now heavily renovated, looking much better and is used as a village hall.</p>
<p>This evening John and Rose have been out to Stomp, a very exciting percussion/dance show with all the Emericks.  They came home at about 9:45 very excited and hyper.  I have been out to the Scarcroft pub quiz for a bit - with Kjartan comparing the quiz.  Shame I won't find out the answers!</p>
