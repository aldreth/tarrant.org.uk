Great excitement, as I\'ve booked us a holiday in Turkey over Easter.
We\'re going to stay in a [hotel][1] that David Campbell recommended,
and fly from Gatwick to Dalaman. It\'s just about on the beach, and in
April Turkey should be pretty warm, so I expect we\'ll spend quite a lot
of time not doing very much. Then in the summer we\'re going to Florence
with Helen and David. So plenty of holidays this year.

It\'s been so cold today that it makes the idea of a warm holiday even
more enticing. I\'ve been feeling a bit run down today, so didn\'t do
anything but doze in a hot bath this afternoon.
