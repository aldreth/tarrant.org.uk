Millthorpe have got a training day today, so John and Toby are at home. 
John and I are going together to Tropical World in Leeds to look at
butterflies and things and then coming home for Rose\'s assembly - she
won a £10 voucher in a raffle for people who cycled to school (!) and is
going to have it presented to her this afternoon.

There was a fantastic [article][1] by Mark Thomas in yesterday\'s
Guardian all about the withdrawal of the right to protest near the
Houses of Parliament.  Apparently people are protesting about this by
sticking to the letter of the law - and producing huge amounts of
paperwork for the police.
