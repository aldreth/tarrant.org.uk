Toby is feeling rather agrieved this morning, as the papershop where he
has diligently and very reliably done a paper round for the last 2 years
has changed hands (again - that\'s twice since Christmas) and are
stopping deliving papers. From next Monday. So he\'ll be out of a job. I
expect that for a short while the lie in will nice, but it\'ll soon be
out weighed by the lack of money.

It seems very short sighted of the shop - they can\'t expect to sell all
the papers that they deliver at the moment. Surely not everyone will get
up, get a paper, and then go home to read it?

Actually I am fired as of today - that\'s zero days notice! Oh well I
find a new job soon

Toby
