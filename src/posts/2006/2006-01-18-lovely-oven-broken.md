I used our super new oven to grill sausages on Saturday, then when I
came to use it to make baked potatoes on Monday, it didn\'t work.

Someone is coming to look at it on Tuesday next week.  I hope they find
something silly that I haven\'t noticed.  I\'ve tried everything obvious
though, and it won\'t work.  **Urgh!**
