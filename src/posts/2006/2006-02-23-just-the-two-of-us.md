On Thursday night Just the two of us started, on BBC 1. I thought it was
okay, but the celebrities weren\'t very good because I hadn\'t heard of
most of them. And I had only heard of one of the proper singers, which
was Jo O\'Meara only because she had been in S Club 7. Vernon Kay and
Tess Daly presented it and I think that they were good especially Vernon
because he is more fun than Tess. They were following in the footsteps
of Richard and Judy, Vernon and Tess are married and this is their first
presenting job together. But I\'m sure that they will have more to come.
I knew one of the judges which was Trevor Nelson from Radio one, but
I\'ve vaguely heard of Lulu was she a singer? I want Matt and Jocelyn to
win because I thought that they put on a really good performance and
Matt can sing a bit, but Jocelyn has an amazing big voice. Visit the[
website ][1]for more info and to find out when it is next on.

This is my first ever entry but I will continue.
