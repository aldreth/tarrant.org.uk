Yesterday I taught Luigi and Clara - for the first time this week as
they\'ve been in Italy. I had lunch with my dad and then went off to
play badminton with Mark.

Unfortunately, there was a school using all the badminton courts, so we
ended up playing squash and as I\'m no good at squash he beat me. Pah!

John went to Youth Theatre Yorkshire at the Theatre Royal in the
evening. Another new activity for a new year. It was his third session,
and he really enjoyed it again. They\'re doing things related to [Sing
Yer Hearts Out for the Lads][1] so it was all football chants last
night.

I was worn out so went to bed early.
