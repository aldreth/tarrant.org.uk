Fixed - well it wasn\'t actually broken! As I suspected, a button had
got pressed. If you hold down one of the buttons for ten seconds, and
then press a different button, the oven gets put in \"demo mode.\" This
means that it won\'t turn on the heating elements or the fan whatever
you turn the knob to. The lights come on, and the buttons adjust the
temperature, but nothing happens. And it remembers it has been put into
this mode even if you turn it off and on again at the wall!

So fortunately it wasn\'t really broken, and I should have read the
small print in the manual more carefully!
