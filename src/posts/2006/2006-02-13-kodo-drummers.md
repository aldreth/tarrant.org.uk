On Sunday we went over to Manchester to see the [Kodo Drummers][1], for
John\'s Christmas present.

We went on the train in the morning and first went to the newish
[Imperial War Museum in the North][2]. We had lunch in the cafe there,
and then John and I took part in a dance workshop doing the [Big
Apple][3] - a dance from the 20s/30s. The teachers were both fairly old,
and started by showing us a jive - which showed that they were still
pretty fit. John was very good and I almost got the hang of it. Then we
moved onto a jive which I didn\'t get the hang of at all. We spent a
while longer in the museum (the highlight of which seemed to be the free
table football game in the cafe).

Tea in Pizza Express - should have tried harder to find somewhere more
interesting, but can\'t do everything. And on to the Bridgewater Hall
for the drumming - lovely concert hall with a brilliant acoustic - the
flute that got played during some of the pieces was still really clear
over the hugely loud drumming. The toweling thong jock straps that the
drummers wore during one of the songs caused some amusement! Highlights
were a piece with 7 tuned drums, each one about a semitone apart, but
not all tuned to a western scale, which beat in and out of time with
each other sounding like a train or plane; a sort of comic bit with
three players playing a tiny drum, cymbals and a flat tennis racquet
like drum, who strode around the stage pretending to beat huge
instruments; and the encore with all the drummers on at once. It\'s very
difficult to describe what was good about each piece - I bet people who
play percussion have a whole vocabulary that I don\'t know.

We got home at half past midnight and so I was very proud when all the
children managed to get up for school on Monday morning!
