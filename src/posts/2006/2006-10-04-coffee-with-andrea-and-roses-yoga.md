I had coffee with Andrea this morning - two hours putting the world to
rights.

Rose went for her third [yoga][1] session and really enjoyed it again.
We\'ve been looking for a children\'s yoga class for a while and these
have finally started up - and they\'re dead local. She goes with Gemma
and at the moment there are only the two of them in the class. They were
doing handstands - definitely more than I can manage!
