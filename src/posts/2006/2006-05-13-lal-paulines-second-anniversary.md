We went over to Lal and Pauline\'s today. Last year they had fantastic
weather, but unfortunately it was grey and drizzly today. Still a lovely
afternoon though. They\'d got a bouncy castle for the children to play
on, and even though it was damp and cold, Toby, John and Rose all
enjoyed it. Toby as enjoyed making very knowledgeable comments while
watching the FA cup.
