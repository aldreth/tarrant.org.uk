On Monday evening Rose and I went up to Millthorpe for their open
evening. It\'s very odd to think that next year I won\'t have any
children at Scarcroft - for the first time in 11 years! I\'m already
missing the morning school run, because Rose is walking to school by
herself and next year I won\'t get the afternoon one either. When on
earth will I pick up all the gossip - or some days talk to anyone at
all!

John was busy at school being a model pupil in a French class, which we
went to watch. We managed to avoid having to listen to the head\'s talk,
which was a relief because he isn\'t the world\'s greatest speaker. We
vaguely wandered around looking at bits and pieces - fantastic art rooms
- but I couldn\'t be bothered to think of any intelligent questions to
ask pupils or teachers. As Rose said when I asked her if she wanted to
go and look around All Saints, \"Not really, I\'m going to go to
Millthorpe, aren\'t I?\"
