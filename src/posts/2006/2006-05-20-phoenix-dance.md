John and I went to see [Stories in Red][1] the current Phoenix Dance
production at the WYP last night. John has gone a couple of times
before, but with Cindy, so I\'ve never seen them before.

It was quite strange, and very gripping. Some of the dances didn\'t have
much of what I would think of as \"dancing\" in them, but that is
probably just my ignorance! We saw Jeanetta, who used to teach John
dance, and John would like to go back, as long as Isaac will go too.
That\'s a result in itself.
