The Guardian published [top 10 book lists][1] that three authors think
children should have read by the time they leave school.

I\'ve read most of the books in JK Rowling\'s and Philip Pullman\'s
lists, and only two (plus watching the play of a third) of Andrew
Motion\'s list. His looks very intellectual to me.
