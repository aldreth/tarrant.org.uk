We\'ve just got back from a lovely holiday in Patara, Turkey.

The hotel was pretty luxurious, and was run by two lovely people, Anne
Louise and Muzaffer. Muzaffer was a fascinating person, when he was
growing up his family was still nomadic, and he was full of information
about the region and its history.

We spent most of our time on the beach, but we did visit some ruins, go
on a boat trip, visit a couple of the local towns and play a lot of card
games. It was very sunny for most of the time, but it did rain for a
couple of days, and was grey on a couple of others. We\'ve all come home
very brown, and feeling rested.
