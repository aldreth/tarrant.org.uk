I had coffee this morning with Mark and Michelle - nice to see them at
the same time!

After lunch I went to the cinema to see [Brokeback Mountain][1] - in the
afternoon, all by myself.  Wonderfully decadent.  It always seems
strange coming out of the cinema into daylight.  Great film, beautiful
scenery, very touching love story.

It was Toby\'s parents\' evening today.  What a star he is - his (in
fact all three children\'s) parents\' evenings are always very
straightforward.  Lovely to have people telling me such nice things
about Toby!
