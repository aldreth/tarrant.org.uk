Toby had his first weekend lie in for ages as the paper shop has now
shut, so he\'s unemployed.  He\'s hoping to get a job in the bike shop
where he did his work experience soon, which would make his Saturday\'s
less leisured than today\'s was.

I cycled with John over to Canon Lee for his dancing, and then went into
town for coffee.  Rose had Lily over to play during the afternoon - they
made burnt chocolate buns!  We had delicious mussels for tea.

John went to Tom\'s for a birthday sleepover and I left Rose and Toby
\"home alone\" while I went to the theatre with Sam to see [How Many
Miles to Basra?][1]  It was very thought provoking - quite heavy and
political.
