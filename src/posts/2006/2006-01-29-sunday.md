I went to Meeting this morning with Rose, while John had a leisurely
morning. Lily came home with us to play with Rose.

Lal and Pauline brought Toby home, they had taken some photos of Toby
skiing.

He had had a fantastic time and had only fallen over a few times. He\'s
only got one visible scrape, on his chin.Â  Predictably enough he learnt
very quickly and was one of the better pupils in the group.

We\'ve had lovely roast lamb for tea and now everyone is going to bed.
