The BBC rang up on Friday asking if John would do a report for [Big
Toe][1]. They had our phone number because he was on last year, when he
did a report about Chinese New Year.  They must be very short of
reporters to be phoning around!

This time round he did a report on scuba diving, which he actually did a
while ago, but he pretended that it was recent.  A very good account,
well written and well read.

You can listen to it for the next few days from the BBC Listen Again
player.  It was Saturday\'s Big Toe.
