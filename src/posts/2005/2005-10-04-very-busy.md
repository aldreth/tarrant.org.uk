      lovely to be able to read a new edition to the diaries, I too am finding
      it very hard still in coming to terms with all that has happened - good
      days and bad, and still the tears come - thinking of you all with lots of
      love  - Jayne xx

It seems strange writing here now, which is one reason why I haven\'t
posted for a week or so. But I intend to carry on using the diary, so
I\'ll just start writing!

I feel as though we are very busy at the moment and that I\'m running to
stand still. The children are continuing with their various activities -
gym, dance, squash, homework, school (of course), piano... which makes
us busy enough anyway, and of couse there is only me to take and pick
up. Lots of people are being very helpful with lifts and so on (big
thanks to Saffron & Jenny, Mark & Michelle and particularly my parents),
but it still feels busy. I\'m also having a bit of trouble holding in my
head who\'s doing what when - but then the start of term is always like
that.

I\'m busy in the day time too - still lots of paper work to get through
and it\'s always nice seeing friends for coffee etc. I\'m also playing
badminton with Simon as usual and with Bill today for a change.

We\'re all ok most of the time - quite tired, finding it a bit difficult
to get to sleep, but mostly ok. All of us are sad from time to time of
course.

The house feels very quiet - it\'s like when one of the children go away
for the weekend. You can just feel something missing all the time. I\'m
sure I\'ll eventually get used to it, but it is strange.
