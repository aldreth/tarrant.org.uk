It is very difficult to get up. Any effort now seems enormous. James, Emma and crew arrive around lunchtime. Manage to get up about 3pm and E pushes me down to the park. Return and have tea with L + M who have brought wine + plant for our anniversary. T makes a very good meatball supper. I sleep again between tea and supper so in balance have spent the best part of the day in bed! Children all getting on really well. R sounds very in control in bathing Hannah and J washes her hair.
