Second morning of textiles. Rose completed background stitching and stitching on the sheep - looks good.

Drive to Bridlington with L+M for walk along beach & fish & chips - very good, freshly cooked. Phoenix Dance with J+R. Excellent first piece, other 2 a bit too modern for J+R - great costumes. E to Oceans 12 with Toby.
