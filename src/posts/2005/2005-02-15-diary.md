Chemo 7 - bit of a disappointing scan; described as 'stable', but sounded 'worse' to me. However, do feel better & have been v. ill & bounced back plus treatments seem to really kick in near the end of the course. Will persevere & maintain faith. Lovely lunch at No 8 with Many & Tom - lovely to see Tom relaxed and chatty too. Bought crafty bits for Rose's wedding ring box. Busy eve @ Toby's GCSE choices presentation, Rose gym, John gym & E out for supper.
