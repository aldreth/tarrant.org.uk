John and Rose were off school yesterday, as it was a teacher training
day.

Rose\'s friend Anna had organised a day filming a play, so Rose was over
there all day and had a super time.

John wanted to go to [Eden Camp][1] again (he went with school last
year.) We left after dropping Rose at Anna\'s and spent several hours
looking around this very interesting museum. His history topic last year
has left him very interested in World War II - he keeps getting books,
Vera Lynn cds and other bits and pieces.

Toby had to go to school, of couse, but Fridays are a good day for him,
so he wasn\'t too put out. He\'s got a training day in a couple of weeks
anyway.
