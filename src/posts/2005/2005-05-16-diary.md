Rose not well with a temperature and has stayed at home mooching in pyjamas. Cut out mock trousers for Eleanor before setting off for Leeds. Curious Reiki with Robert - could not discern where he was at times and if he still had his hands on me. Very nice all the same. Lunch of home made soup + wheat germ bread with Ruth + David Corry and then Ruth gave me a foot massage. Magical lying back listening to logs crackle on the fire and the wind chimes in the garden. Collected M from station carrying Betty's fare from her course. Enjoyed a lovely chocolate tart after E's v. nice shepherds pie.
