Very windy morning, felt quite worried about Toby out on his paper-round this morning. Managed to walk Rose to dance, E. picked her up. Jean came bearing cream cake and allotment goodies. Always good to see her. Have arrange to go to the cinema on Thurs. Gentle afternooon saving energy for Debbie's party. Nice, but strange with no John & about 2 other women going through a divorce. What is going on?
