Yesterday I tidied up the kitchen, rubbed down bits of woodwork, cleared
up plaster and so on.

Today, I have got two coats of watered down white all over the walls and
ceiling. Then Dave arrived to help with one coat of white on ceiling,
one coat of blue on the end wall and putting the radiator back on. So
real progress has been made today.

It looks amazingly different with just this much paint on - it\'s really
starting to look like a proper room! Not all progress will be this fast,
there are lots of fiddly electrical and plumbing fixings to do and no
doubt some of the cupboards will take a while to fix in properly, but it
really feels as though it is coming along.

Photos will follow when I\'ve found my cardreader for the camera - it\'s
somewhere in the mess!
