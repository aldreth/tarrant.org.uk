It was Lal and Pauline\'s first anniversary, so they had a party to
celebrate. They\'ve also done a lot to their garden, so it was a garden
christening party too. We went over on Saturday afternoon, after J+R\'s
dancing (John didn\'t go - too tired!).

Pauline had done some lovely food - dips, salmon, salads... Cindy had
done a chocolate fudge cake (from Nigella Lawson - yum yum).

We didn\'t stay as long as we\'d intended, because the children were
worn out! We got home in time for Doctor Who (Doctor Who actually moving
shock - it was the one about [Rose\'s dad][1]).

And so to bed - early. Sleepovers definitely only at weekends - on a
school day this level of borderline grumpiness would have been
unbearable!
