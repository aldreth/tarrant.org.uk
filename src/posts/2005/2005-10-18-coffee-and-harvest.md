I had coffee with Michelle this morning at the Blakehead Bookshop and
Café - oh yeah and a huge plate of mushrooms on toast. Long chat. She
had Dominic with her - what a charming child, smiley and cheerful.

Then in the afternoon it was John and Rose\'s Harvest festival.
Excellent as all Scarcroft things seem to be at the moment. Rose\'s
class sang several WWII songs - not really a harvest link, but...
John\'s class didn\'t do a huge amount - 1 poem - but I expect that all
their effort went into last Friday\'s superb Good Work Assembly.

John has no gym this week or next, and Rose was taken by Jenny and
picked up by Mark, so not a busy evening. Early to bed.
