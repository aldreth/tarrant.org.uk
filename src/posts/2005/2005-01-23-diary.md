Toby didn't want to ice biscuits with me at Meeting - no Luke or Jordan, so he went home. Ran the activity with 7 Fell Group however - great fun and they were all very good. Felt very worn out however. Wish I had more energy! Cooked Sunday lunch. Toby to Will Emerick's and Edward took John + Rose over to Lily's. Managed a sit down + a bit of knitting. Lance came for supper and we had an evening of TV goggleing altoghether except for Rose who was rather hooked on the Sims. Boys love watchin "Top Gear"!!
