I\'m back to school tomorrow. I\'m in for two and a half days this week,
and am helping out and planning rather than being in charge - that
starts next week.

I am apprehensive, but I think that it will be one of those situations
that will be alright once it starts. Definitely better to be getting
stuck in than carrying on worrying.

Also - there are only five weeks till the end of term, and I\'m not
doing a full week till the last week of term. So I hope I\'ll be sorted
and settled by then. Huge summer term to slog through - but worrying
about that can wait.

I probably won\'t update this as often now I\'ll have \"proper\" things
to do - but will try to keep it at least weekly.
