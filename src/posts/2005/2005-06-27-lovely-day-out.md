Today we drove to the [Yorkshire Sculpture Park][1], which is near
Wakefield. It was a glorious day - hot and sunny. We walked around parts
of the park, saw some Henry Moores, Barbara Hepworths and a William
Turnbull retrospective, part of which was in the new underground
gallery. Read the paper in the sunshine, had a nice lunch in the cafe
and then came home.

Fantastic.
