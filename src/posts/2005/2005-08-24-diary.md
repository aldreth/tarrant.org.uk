All went to the Castle Museum this morning. Lots of heavy rain. E + R came back early as R had had enough. Helen, David + Sam came for lunch. They're on their way back to London. Did lunch very much in two sittings. James and Emma decide to go after tea, so the men take the children off to the wood and Emma + I put together a chilli. Lovely having them to stay and the children all got on really well. Very nice to have space back too and catch our breath before the next guests arrive!
