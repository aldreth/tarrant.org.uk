Had a devastating beetroot + celery juice this morning - had the effect of a mega scouring pad. E consequently had to cook Sunday lunch whilst I rested up on the sofa! Pauline looking very tanned from her Turkish holiday. Enjoyed nice roast lamb + strawbs + meringues. Chilled cava. Everybody to the park whilst I rested up on the sofa. R had a miserable moment, but thankfully recovered. Extremely hot again. Back yard looked like it was gasping. Watered Mary's garden - takes ages there's so much in it.
