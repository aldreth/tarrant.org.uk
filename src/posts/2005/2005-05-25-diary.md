Picked up my 'Potato Eaters' - like it very much - E still doesn't like it. Good last Italian lesson - included the barber's song from Figaro. Spent snatches of time sitting in the yard, it really is looking great at the moment.

Judith bought me back a lovely bottle stopper from her holiday in France. Yoga was excellent this evening. Realised I'd been getting the 'locks' wrong - managed it tonight - very energising when done properly.
