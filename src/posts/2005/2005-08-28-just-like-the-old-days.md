Phil and Marcia are visiting (with Claudia and Lucas) and we\'ve just
finished playing cards - just like when they used to live in Yarm and we
were in Acomb. We\'ve also been eating [Betty][1]\'s cake and drinking
Betty\'s coffee - what we did *back then*! More children now though.

Rose, Claudia, Phil and I went on a [Breadcrumbs][2] trail earlier
today, while John, Lucas and Marcia went to the [NRM][3].

During the late afternoon, we got over excited to the point of barely
being able to watch the tv - [exciting finish][4] to the [4th Test][5].

Cindy has been very tired and achy today, she got up around lunch time,
and had to go back to bed before supper, and hasn\'t eaten properly this
evening.
