Left Toby, Lal + Pauline getting up slowly and cycled off to meeting. A very quiet Meeting. Philip Rack's piece from Faith + Practice came to mind. Discovered after Meeting it was the piece in Quakevine this month - strange that. Did the coffee with a very fragile woman who told me too much too soon. Was joined by Andrew + Ian both of whom always end up singing - have spent quite a few 'drying times' with these two.

All to L+M for a very nice roast lamb dinner followed by meringues. Played 'Perudo' - I won, 'wayhay'! - and then Lal + Pauline set off home. Crumpet + muffin tea. We now have the gas stove. E + I stayed up late watching 'enigma' -very good. Slept well. Feeling much much better.
