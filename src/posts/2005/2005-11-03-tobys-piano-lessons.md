Toby decided after the summer holiday that he wanted to have piano
lessons again. He tinkled quite a lot over the summer and learnt some
music from \"[Pop Hits][1].\" I think he wants to do it partly because
he\'s doing Music GCSE, partly because he can use it towards his Duke of
Edinburgh Award, and partly because he was enjoying playing again.

The first teacher we found didn\'t turn out very well - he was a little
odd and Toby just didn\'t like his style of teaching or playing.

The new teacher Toby has got is a young man who is doing a Master\'s
degree in Improvised Music and Jazz at the University. He\'s very keen
and enthusiastic, has been teaching for several years already, and Toby
is really enjoying it. Toby\'s learning to improvise, learning some
boogie woogie tunes and playing the piano frequently - which regardless
of anything else has got to be good.
