Cooked solidly all day for the freezer. Toby back to bed + slept till lunch. E still not well + in bed too for most of the day. Can't remember the last time he had to take to his bed. E+I to see 'A Doll's House' @ the W. Yorkshire. Really excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed a night out - just us two. Sam looked after the children. Chatted a lot with Toby + did some making with Rose. Blue Peter annuals for John.
