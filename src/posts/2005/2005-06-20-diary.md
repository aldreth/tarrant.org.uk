E's birthday and all sit on the bed for modest pressie opening. Such a busy weekend and father's day yesterday had left them all in disbelief that more celebrating was required of them today. E takes T to the dentist - has his brace off. Judy round for coffee then I dash off + shop for supper. Lovely meze style lunch before prep supper. Weaving with Deborah at the after school club - feel cheated of the opportunity to apply for a job at All Saints. Finish off tea prep. Steve + Sam, Josh + Tom round for supper. Sit in yard and enjoy good veggie fare - very nice frittata that all enjoyed - will try again. Dave arrives and after supper takes J + R to the park. Midsummers Day - finish the evening watering flowers. Yard looks lovely.
