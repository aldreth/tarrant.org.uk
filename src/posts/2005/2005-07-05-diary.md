Met up with Alison Forrester for coffee at the Blakeshead. Sat in the garden until a huge downpour chased us inside. Alison ready to slide into lunch - no fear! Make away when the weather breaks. Pick up some groceries on the way home + make lunch. E out walking with Ted. Finish off embroidering Jane's silk wedding dress squares and generally rest. Jenny does the whole gym run, so just have to sort John out. He's had a bit of a tummy ache, but seems ok now. Feeling very drained again. Horrible cough. Breathless. Reading good book, Kensuke's Kingdom.
