Sodens round for breakfast after the 8am birdwalk in the park. All came back boasting new knowledge of bird calls. Managed to accommodate all of us for cooked breakfast. Our new grill in full swing - really good. Set off for Hunmanby Gap despite misgivings about the weather. Bit of a shower en route, but the rest of the day was really lovely. Tide receding. E built a fire and the children donned wetsuits and were barely out of the water. Jo + Bill came for a couple of hours. Didn't get back until about 7 v. tired and hungry.
