Woke quite late this morning - didn't even hear Toby go out. Thought I'd taken the morning slowly, but had a nasty breathing episode after having a wee. Took me quite a time to recover, I felt exhausted. Edward into town with John + Rose. Toby still doing bits on his truck and over to Andy's in the afternoon. After E cycles to L + M's to return computer box and picks up O2 prescription. he returns and carries me downstairs and takes me for a walk. Absolutely fantastic to get outside. Warm and a light breeze on my face. Glistening river water, people out enjoying themselves. Lovely. Sat at the table for tea and then outside in the yard for coffee. Great afternoon.
