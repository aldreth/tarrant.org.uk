Set off for Hunmanby after breakfast - boot stuffed with body board and skim boards. Tide coming in, bright sun and variable cloud made for a really great 3 hours. R found an ammonite revealed when E managed to crack open the stone. R + J in the water for most of the time. Changing nature of the water is fascinating to watch as the tide moves up the beach. T arrived home looking weathered. He' had a great time and was full of tales of teachers 'coping' with teenagers on a w/end away. Dashed over to L+M to watch Dr Who. Me to bed on return; temperature going up + down and just feeling off. Leave E to cope with washing up, wetsuits + stories.
