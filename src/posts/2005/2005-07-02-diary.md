Feeling not very good this morning. Contemplate getting T to take R to dance, but manage to get myself out. Take it slow. Cook T and I some breakfast + then return to pick up R. Then time to take off to Elvington for John's dance. He and his group were very good. Off to Jo + Bill's for BBQ. Have a really nice evening sitting and chatting in the garden. Children watch Live Aid concert - finish watching it at home. All go to bed very late.
