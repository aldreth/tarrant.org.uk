Decided against the V+A and arranged to meet Jane + Andy for lunch. London Bridge was teeming and we arrived just in time for the 2 min silent memorial for last weeks bomb's.

Sushi lunch - very interesting and very nice. I had just about used up my energy by then and we bid farewell and taxied over to Kings X and caught a much earlier train. Nice journey back. Home just as children and L + M were eating tea. A lovely trip.
