Woke feeling very breathy and with a pain in my chest. I was extremely slow. Nice breakfast in the garden and then we eventually set off for Eltham Palace - Art Deco feast established by the Courtaulds. The gardens - that we hadn't seen last time - were lovely. Very, very hot. By the end of the afternoon I realised that I had an infection. Had felt very spaced out at times and was glad of the wheelchair. Managed to see a doctor and get some antibiotics. Lovely pasta supper.
