Cindy went in today for her sixth chemo in this round. She is fine this
evening, but will no doubt get exhaused over the next few days. The side
effects of this sort of chemo aren\'t too bad though, and because it
seems to be having a positive effect Dr Bottomley has suggested that
Cindy have a few (2-4) more doses, spaced 3 weeks apart as so far.

Cindy is doing pretty well. She is a lot less short of breath, can get
upstairs without needing oxygen or having to pause and generally has
more energy than in October/November. As usual, she is amazingly
positive, vibrant and full of enthusiam.
