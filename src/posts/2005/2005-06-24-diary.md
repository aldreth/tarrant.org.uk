Saw the funniest play this evening '39 Steps' the last of our Big Night Out from L + M. Have bought E the next lot and he bought me one this evening. 4 actors played 150 parts - really clever + very funny - theatre packed. Set up my water fountain in a very nice pot from Homebase - really pleased with it - just what I wanted. Mandy arrives bearing her usual goody bag. J walks home alone and R off for sleep over. L + M back, M joins us for a cup of tea. T elbowed in face in football.
