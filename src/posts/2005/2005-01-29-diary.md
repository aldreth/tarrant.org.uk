Took Rose to dance and managed a bit of Bishy Rd. shopping. Still feeling the chemo, so back to bed in the afternoon. Felt better in the late afternoon and manage to put together lemon chicken + finish off the squidgy choc log. Good supper with Kath + an evening supping beer + wine. Toby a bit left out as J+R at a sleepover and Louis went to a gig at the Winning Post.
