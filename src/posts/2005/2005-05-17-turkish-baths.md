I went with Ted today over to Harrogate to go to the Turkish Baths (info
[here][1] and [here][2]).

As usual, wonderfully relaxing and pleasant experience. Followed by
tapas, then back on the train just in time to pick the children up from
school.

Sheer luxury - definitely better than being at work!
