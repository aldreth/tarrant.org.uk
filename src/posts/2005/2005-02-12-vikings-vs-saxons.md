We went down to the Eye of York this afternoon to watch a battle between
the Vikings and the Saxons. It was supposed to be 1066 and the Battle of
Stamford Bridge, so the Vikings lost.

It was a bit dull to be honest, but John and Rose enjoyed it.

It made me think of something that had crossed my mind at the Chinese
Parade earlier in the week. Lots of people there were taking photos,
either with digital cameras or with camera phones. Most of the photos
will have the top of the person in front\'s head, and in the dark the
action was too far away for the flash to have worked, so there must be
an awful lot of fairly rubbish photos out there somewhere - what happens
to them all? Do people save them, print them out, send them to other
people with modern phones, or are there 500 photos of the Viking
Festival out there on the net somewhere? An over documented world - with
most of the information of poor quality?
