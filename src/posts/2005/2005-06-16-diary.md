Go into York to look for pressie inspiration + buy pedal for my bike - pretty much run out of steam, very quickly - have to rest at Capaldis - very convenient! Sainsburys after lunch + then definitely run out of energy. All the walking yesterday has exhausted me beyond my reckoning - lots of pathetic lounging around feeling weary for, not of, day. How have I managed to get in this state. In my head I'm running + busy. Really find it difficult to tolerate today.
