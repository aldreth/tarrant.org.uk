Drove to M + D, lunching on the way. Beautiful day and rather a shame to spend it in the car. Arrive about 5:30 and after supper spend time relaxing and catching up with each other. Sarah + Michael join us for supper with their little boy Adam sporting a new digital hearing aid (Â£2,000!) - v amazing. Hardly noticeable + had made a huge difference to him at school.
