Rose very anxious this morning. Decides she want me to go. Outcome - success. R manages examination + x ray. No treatment as yet - review in a year - thank goodness. Advises her to stop sucking her thumb. Go to Meltons Too for late breakfast + then R + I buy stuffed lion + cat bed for Daisy in charity shop. T home - hurray - have missed him. He's had a lovely time and was clearly not daunted by staying with Tobias's family.
