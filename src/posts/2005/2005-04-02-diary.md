Il Giornale is too difficult for me! Lovely morning. J + R + I do a round tour of Bishy shops. After lunch Rose goes to Lauren's & J + I cycle into town for cupboard handles + red jumper. Buy a CD for Rose. Phone Toby to join us for ice creams, our first @ Capaldi's this year. Nice to sit with J + T looking up at the Minster - bit covered in scaffolding. Mandy arrives - lovely to see her. Dave struggling over a short for too long in the evening. The Pope dies.
