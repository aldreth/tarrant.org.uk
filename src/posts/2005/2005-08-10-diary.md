More swimming in the stream for the children today - Katharine + Jane also. Rock climbing with Will in the morning using ropes. Despite initial hesitations J + R enjoyed it, E later told me. M, J + I had a lovely sit + chat in the garden in the morning. Beautiful sunshine and view down sloping lawn with generous borders and mature trees. J + E off to buy boots + rock climbing harness for the children in the afternoon! W + S a walk by themselves + the rest to the train. I enjoyed the solitude of the garden - sort of! So much would love a walk, a run, a swim, something active. Don't want to be too long like this. Cards with Jane, R, M, M + L. T, M + I watch the rest of Silent Witness. Sleep v badly.
