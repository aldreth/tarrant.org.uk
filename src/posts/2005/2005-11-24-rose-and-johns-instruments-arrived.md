I picked up Rose\'s flute and John\'s saxophone on Tuesday and today is
the day of their lessons. Rose had borrowed a flute from Sam, so she\'s
had one lesson already, and can play G, A, B &amp; C!! It\'ll be John\'s
first go though, we haven\'t even put the reed in his sax yet, in case
we got it wrong. He has of course been posing with it, standing on a
chair in the kitchen waving it around this morning for instance. Perhaps
this evening he\'ll actually be able to make a note.
