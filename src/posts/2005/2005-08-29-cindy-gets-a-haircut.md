Just taken Cindy up to Brian\'s for a haircut. Her hair has gradually
grown, till now it looked a bit mad and wild. Much better now, short
still, but it looks deliberate!

She didn\'t get up today till 6ish - feeling very tired and breathless.

The rest of us walked round the city walls with Phil and Marcia and then
went for pizzas at La Piazza. P+M left at about 3. Last visitors for a
while - we should have a chance to settle down and sort our selves out a
bit before school starts next week. Lovely to see everyone, but a bit
busy.
