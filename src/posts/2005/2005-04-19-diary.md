Bobbed into Sam;s for coffee & chat this morning - always nice to spend time with Sam. Rose off sick with a temperature & need to get back for E to play badminton with Simon + then go into school for final chat. He seems to be feeling glad to get things sorted so that he can move on. Dr S has signed him off for as long as is needed.
