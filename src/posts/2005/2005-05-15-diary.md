Having a very lazy day. E took the children to Meeting and after listening to a gripping radio play - that didn't conclude today! - got up for 11am!! Sitting here in the yard with sun umbrella, it is absolutely lovely. E, J + R + Lil @ the Edmund Wilson and T + Luke on the Xbox. T has bought me a very thoughtful present 'Creature Comforts' (be it at the Â£ shop - he has a good eye for a bargain!) Will eventually move myself to cook chicken.
