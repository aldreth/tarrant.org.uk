Whitby today with mary leaving E to work. Lovely day. Packed up wheelchair as still not walking very far. Whitby was amazingly busy. Had FnCs as soon as we got there. Then on to the beach. J+R went in. Toby looked out over the harbour for a long time. It was quite busy + interesting. On balance we didn't really do a great deal, but it was a lovely day.
