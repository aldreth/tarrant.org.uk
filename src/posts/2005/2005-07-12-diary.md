The ticket collector didn't even look at the tickets - relaxed into the journey. David met us at Kings X. Very hectic outside. Camera crews and news reporters around the collection of flowers. The buses were busy with much of the tube being out of action. Went past the street blocked where the no 30 bus blew up. All very strange. Met Helen at the portrait gallery and had lunch in the basement before searching out the Frida Kahlo. Returned to H + D for cool refreshment before setting off for Jane Byrne's about 1/2 walk away. She has a small house on a terrace and has just decorated bits of it. Back to D + H and chatted to Sam for a bit.
