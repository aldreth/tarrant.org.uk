So lovely to have the house moving back to normality. No building work and no more cramped back room. Slowly decanting boxes into cupboards - it's all a very tight squeeze. Lovely Reiki with Robert - very very relaxing. J+R walked back home by themselves! E terrible, terrible day, he looked so drained. Took the children to the park after a shower and he looked much lifted.

Started 4th Anne book with Rose + a book for J. He's not had much reading to lately.
