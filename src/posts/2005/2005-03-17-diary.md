John had a boa constrictor around his neck today; it stretch up and 'licked' his face. John thought it was lovely!! Then had his photo taken with a tarantula - this was lovely too. Got some antibiotics for sore throat + cough - feel very rough this evening. Floor to be laid tomorrow + we're moving back tomorrow!
