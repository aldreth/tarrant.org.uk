School concert at Scarcroft this evening. E takes me up the back stairs to avoid the crowds as I need the oxygen. Very packed. Lots of solos. Anna and Tom very good on trumpet and trombone respectively. R sings in the choir and takes part in the street dance. J in with his class singing. We only have another 2 summer concerts to attend after tonight! Tidy the yard. It's staring to look a little heat exhausted. E attacks the bush at the front.
