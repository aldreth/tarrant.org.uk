Sore throat + felling very coldy. Managed the Fox group. Couldn't believe I'd left my book at home with the library book that took me ages to find. Sweet little girls all made a Rosemary cross and Donkey. Spent the afternoon in bed. E suggested La Piazza for tea. Cheered us all up, all the nicer because it was so unexpected. Great pizzas. I had cannelloni. Children enjoyed it - as usual. Toby won gold at trampoline. Rose competed in final, but not placed. She was disappointed, especially after Tuesday's silver.
