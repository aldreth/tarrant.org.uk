E off to buy paint with John and Rose + I set off to take things to Age Concern + get a bit of shopping. Driving necessary, but feeling better. Lal + Pauline arrived at about 2pm. We played Harry Potter. New 'Dr Who' - Lance arrived in good time to watch this! 7:30 table at Meltons. Me: King Prawn, Hake, choc. Parfait. Lovely wine + dessert wine. Great chees. Very, very nice eventing with L + P v good company. Surrendered our vouchers + Lal treated us to rest - very generous.
