      'Happy Birthday' Cindy ~ always in my thoughts, with love from, Jayne
---

Today would have been Cindy\'s 44<sup>th</sup> birthday.

To celebrate we are going out this evening to La Piazza for a meal.

John, Rose and I have spent the afternoon at Beningbrough Hall with
David, Mimi and Jocelyn Campbell. Have climbed trees, run around, had
scones and generally enjoyed ourselves. Toby has been working very hard
on his graphics project and then went out with Tom Robinson.
