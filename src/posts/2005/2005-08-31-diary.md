Despite spending all day in bed I slept solidly. Woke up and felt very spaced out and strange. Couldn't get to bathroom - resort to bucket - oh the shame! Doze all morning on and off. Children out to party (Rose) and L + M for the day. E makes me some nice butternut squash soup - I manage a little. Then I determine to get up. E pushes me along the hall and with quivering knees I get downstairs. E walks me along the river - absolutely fantastic to be outside. Beautiful day. Bump into children, L + M at Capaldis. Sit in yard. Am a little sick after tea. Manage to sit down for supper. Don't know what has happened, but I feel enormously better compared to yesterday.
