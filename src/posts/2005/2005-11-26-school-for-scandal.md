I\'ve just got all the children into bed after coming back from seeing
[The School for Scandal][1] at York Theatre Royal. It was colourful,
funny, bright and interesting - all things that last week\'s Hamlet
weren\'t. Unfortunately it was also *long* and combined with the heat
this sent both John and Rose to sleep - one on either side of me.

Earlier on today, Toby went to see Huddersfield [play][2] with Keith;
John, Rose & I played the Harry Potter boardgame and then Rose went off
to play with Lily.
