I\'ve just written to our MP about an [article][1] in today\'s Guardian,
about how most cleaners in the Houses of Parliament have very low pay
and poor conditions of work.

I know there are a lot bigger things going on this week ([G8][2],
[London Bomb][3]), but I think if you can\'t get these relatively small
simple things done properly, you don\'t have much hope with the bigger
issues.

I used a fantastic service called [Write to Them][4]. You put your post
code into their webpage, and it finds your Councillors, MP, MEPs, MSPs,
or Welsh and London Assembly Members. You choose who you want to
contact, then write (or paste) your letter into the next page, click and
it sends it to the correct person. If they seem never to check their
email, it sends it by fax instead, which is apparently still more widely
used by MPs. Apparently in a fortnights time they will contact me to see
if Hugh Bailey responds.

Fantastic free, open source, volunteer run service.
