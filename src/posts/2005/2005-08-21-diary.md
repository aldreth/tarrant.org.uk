David and Edward take all to the park and Mandy + I sit in the yard. It is a glorious sunny morning almost too hot to sit outside. Give Mandy my favourite brooch and we have a little weep. Laugh about things past and tell each other how much we mean to each other. Just too emotional really but afterwards we both felt that a tension had cleared. So much having a good time together + determined to enjoy the time and yet knowing what it was really all about. Wave goodbye to them mid afternoon. I watch A Room with a View. T goes off to play tennis with Bill, John to Tom's and E and R cycle over to the woods near Jean. Enjoy a bread + bits supper. Sleep well.
