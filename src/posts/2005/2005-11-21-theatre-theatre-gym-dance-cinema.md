On Friday evening I went to see Jerusalem at the WYP with Lance, while
Mary looked after the children (babysat is no longer the right word).
Judy and Keith, to whom I had given the tickets, had discovered that
they couldn\'t go after all, so after looking for anyone else who was
free, I went.

It was a very good play, seven actors who all played instruments and
sang. They burst into modern pop tunes at various points to fit into the
story. The put upon son sang a Smiths song and the granny sang a very
drunken, aggressive version of Take Me Out. I\'m glad I\'ve been back to
the WYP before we go to see Alice in Wonderland in the new year.

On Saturday Rose went to a birthday party, and then to a sleep-over.
Toby and I went to see Hamlet at the Theatre Royal with Lance and Mary,
and John was looked after by Jean. Hamlet seemed really dull, so Toby
and I left at half time!

On Sunday, John had a gym competition, in which he won silver for his
floor. He\'d made up the routine himself and it was brilliant. Rose was
at the dance festival with school and did a really good dance to
Chattanooga Choo Choo. Then we went out to La Piazza, followed by Harry
Potter at the City Screen.

Very busy weekend.
