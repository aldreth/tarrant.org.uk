E + W off to Nantlle Ridge this morning. Cool and heavy dew outside unless has rained. K + S + T, S + children off to Harlech Castle. R decides she would like to go on the train. M drops us off with L at Porthmadog and we easily while away 1/2 hour before the train. Lovely, lovely journey with beautiful views. Sound of the train whistle, smell of the engine. All very evocative. Waiter service for snacks by very enthusiastic staff. M met at Ffestiniog. Home for lunch + then to the beach where we met up with K, S + T. V hot despite being overcast earlier in the day. Christine, the owner, brought her pony Bluebell round after tea for the children to walk and ride. Rose very taken with her. T retrieves his plane that he'd lost in the tree.
