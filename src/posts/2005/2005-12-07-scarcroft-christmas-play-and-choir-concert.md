This afternoon I went to Scarcroft to watch their Christmas play. It was
mostly acted by year 6 children, with singing from all the rest of the
juniors. John was Narrator 1 and spoke first and last. The play was
about \"Santa\'s Christmas Special \" - a train that goes back in time
and space to an ancient British mid-winter festival, Queen Victoria\'s
Christmas, and the birth of Jesus.

Rose is still at school, going off to Selby this evening with the school
choir to sing in Selby Abbey. John and I are going to watch her later.
