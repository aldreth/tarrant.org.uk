We\'ve had a lovely lunch today with Lance and Mary. Roast Lamb - we
haven\'t had anything roasted for a while (except for chicken on Friday,
Cindy has just pointed out)!

Last night we had a fantastic meal with Lal and Pauline at Melton\'s.

Kitchen paint colour is chosen and bought. All ready to go, just going
to give the plaster another day to dry some more.
