Farewell to Tobi - it seems to have gone very quickly. It has been very nice having him to stay. Scarcroft closed because of broken boiler. J+R had a good time in the snow then off to the park with Jo. Pumpkin soup for us all here. A lovely playday. - quite unexpected. Helen Barnes for a quick visit. She's as busy as ever - was looking really smart. Great to see her. Super Italian.
