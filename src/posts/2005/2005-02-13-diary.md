E to meeting with John. Rose wanted to mooch at home. Toby + Tom on the computer. I got up late still feeling tired + slow with my cough. After soup + cheese lunch all go to Guild hall for Viking craft fair - E bought me a 'Lucet' to make braiding with, very aesthetic craft tool. I stay at home and sew. Nice chicken tea and some evening TV.
