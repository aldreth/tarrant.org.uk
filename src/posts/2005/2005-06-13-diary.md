Wet and very cold - E puts the heating back on. A particularly good Reiki with lots of focus on my chest area. Last bit spoilt rather because I was desperate for the loo. Ask Robert about R feeling panicky - he suggests homeopathy - aconite, go + buy some from Tullivers. Join Deborah for textiles and help thread needles + tie knots! John needs hat making material, dash back to town + buy vilene from Boyes. Hat make with J while E + R watch Dr who. R sad + sobbing again, pop a few more aconites + hope for relief for her.
