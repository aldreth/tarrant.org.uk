Finished M's cake and did some Italian and trouser mending in the morning. E DIY in the kitchen. Italian very good fun - Franco sending me off in the giggles. Booked La Piazza for us all and told him we want to talk Italian! L @ home and we all sang Happy Birthday for M. They are off on holiday for a week to the Baltic. E to scarcroft with J+R for a demonstration drumming lesson and Toby + I to Millthorpe for a German briefing. Dragged myself to yoga - glad I did, very rejuvenating. Milkshake with T on return. Watered garden & part of little + often practice. To bed.
