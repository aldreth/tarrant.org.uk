Rose at home with a temperature. Spent the morning making Jane + Andy's ringbox. Nice to just have some time together. Went to see 'The Play What I Wrote' with Judy. Really excellent - very funny + brilliantly performed. E pranged the car in the ice. Wheel bent. He's ok. E bought FnC for T+T - German T loved them.
