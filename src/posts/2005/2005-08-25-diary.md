Slow + slouchy day for E + the children after so much business. J + R watch Harry Potter - again! T goes to Monks Cross with Josh and Tom. Get E to push me in the park later in the afternoon - need to get outside. Meet Jo with Anna + Adam and J + R decide to go back with them. E + I have coffee opposite the Castle Museum. Go to L + M on the electric bike to have supper with Ãœla and Lilian. We have a very nice supper and it was nice to meet up with them again. T cycles back with me.

Start Tarceva.
