Designer Outlet this morning - bought a nice skirt + some nuts!

Home for lunch and then lazy afternoon knitting. Josh Cole arrives ahead of Toby - he settles down for a cup of tea with J+R! Toby let out late, came in moaning terribly about the textiles. Poor woman, I can imagine Toby must be in with a right rum bunch of year 9's.

E + I put together a new recipe for beany burgers. Mimi + Eleanor come and learn how to use the sewing machine. Wonderful surprise as I get into bed, E has booked supper BnB and the Star Inn at Harome tomorrow. Very excited.
