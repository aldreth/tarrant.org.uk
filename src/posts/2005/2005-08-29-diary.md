All go into town to walk around the walls. T goes to Tom's some time during the morning. E phones me from La Piazza. Phil comes up before they set off to say 'goodbye' - bit emotional. Enjoy some soup and then later an omelette and a small glass of very good wine from E's box from the Wine Society. Decide to make a big effort and get up. Glad I do. E pushes me along the river. J+ R on rollerblades. Return home to phone call from Brian. He cuts my hair. Can't think why I didn't do it earlier.
