Needed the bathroom really early. Huge effort. Breathing starting to hurt now. Got E to push me back from the loo. I keep taking the tablets.

E takes them all to Waterworld. Chat to Judy on the phone. She will come later this week. E returns and takes R off to Boyes to buy a present for Sarah. Mick and Susheila arrive for coffee - made by T. The come and sit upstairs with me. Had hoped to get downstairs, but I'm worried I'll not get back up again. Enjoyed shepherds pie - samosa too spicy - shame! Big cuddle from R.
