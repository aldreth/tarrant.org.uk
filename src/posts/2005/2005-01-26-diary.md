Italian revision + a bit of tidying before Swea came, then off to look at Snowhome sale. Saw nothing we wanted - except look plywood shelf I covet for the kitchen - bit expensive. Drinks in No 8 then I left E to drive back for a quick lunch before Italian. Very very weary. Bed by 6:40 after hot bath. Leaving E to hold the fort. Rose with Mary, Toby at football. John here.
