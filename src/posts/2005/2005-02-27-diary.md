Bfast with Mandy and Amy and then left about 10. Stopped for a coffee + then arrived back about 3pm. Mary out with R+J. Toby's football cancelled. Mary returned with the children + we had tea and a choice of 3 cakes no less! Started on clearing the kitchen. E did a bit of work. Dave on his way! It is 11:37 and the kitchen in pretty much clear - boxes taken over to L+M. TAble in the backroom along with day to day stuff. Everywhere starting to deteriorate into a mess - nowhere near as bad as it will be very soon I suspect.
