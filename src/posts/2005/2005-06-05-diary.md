Feeling extremely grim on getting up. All seems too much of an effort so retire to bed and E takes J + R + T to Meeting. Doze on and off listening to the radio and eventually get up not before everybody gets back. Potter about and then take R to the Castle museum to look at the postcards exhibition. E + J to the city screen for Star Wars movie.

T with Luke had a McDs for lunch!
