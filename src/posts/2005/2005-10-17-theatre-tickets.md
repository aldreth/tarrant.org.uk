Cindy & I had organised this term\'s worth of big deal tickets. I
decided that I didn\'t want to go without her, so I\'ve given them away
to family and friends.

Sam and Steve went to see [Twelfth Night][1] ([review][2]).

Mary and her sister Anne went to see [My Mother Said I Never Should][3]
(Anne said it was *interesting*!).

Judy and Keith are going to see [Jerusalem][4].

And Jo and Bill are going to see [Dead Funny][5].
