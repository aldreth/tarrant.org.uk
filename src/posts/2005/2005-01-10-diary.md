E. to occupational health this morning so I took the children to school. Firt time in ages. Good start to the morning then sick about 1/2 hour before driving to Leeds for a Reiki. Thouth it was the chemo, but now know it's the tummy bug the children have had. Have spent all agernoon in bed feeling very fragile. T. revising hard for school tests. Had to cancel knitting with the girls.
