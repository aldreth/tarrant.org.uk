Managed to get up at a reasonable time and have done a few bits + pieces around the house. Remain very breathy and cannot do anything that requires effort. J off for his first scuba diving class. Really enjoyed it. R to Southlands church for crafts. Refilled the water butt and enjoyed sitting in the yard listening to the fountain. Raised bed is fantastic. Red geraniums + deep crimson potentillas. Grasses flourishing. Chat with Jo - she's off to Rosedale for a couple of days. Catch up with Audrey - cat behaved herself for her. Supper at Mark & Michelle's! Very nice sparkling wine. A meal with an Italian flavour, Green + Black ice cream and very good coffee. Really nice. Excellent evening and the children enjoyed themselves. Beautiful evening + lovely moon to walk home to.
