Credit Union lunch got off to a slow start, but by the finish had actually been very successful - met a very nice woman who teaches M yoga. Chatted to St Clems treasurer + Pauline Buchanan who's very community active. E said he got the 'nutter' + had a 'God' conversation or not!! T home + pleased with his Sci + Maths Sats results - packed his bag and has set off for DofE assessed camping/walking expedition - they're having chicken again! Pains in my back + breathy - hope it's the weather.
