All to Meeting this morning and Rose is invited to the beach with Mimi. Very hat and humid. J, E + I go to Tanya + Charles for croquet and frogs. Their garden is lovely as ever. The very bottom has become wild and overgrown and it was difficult to see the pond. While we played croquet J enjoyed the frogs and the chap next door showed him his terrapin. Had tea in front of the summer house. Lovely sound of solar powered water fountains and wind chimes. Big storm clouds gather overhead! Thunder + lightning on the way home + then tropical cloud burst. Humidity lifts a little. T home from DofE absolutely exhausted + rather bitten. R home from beach late - she's seen a puffin. Phone down in storm.
