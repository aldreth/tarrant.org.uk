Compared to yesterday felt much better. Managed to shower + be up for Gordon's visit at 10:30. He brought me flowers + cakes and sweetest sincere wishes. He's off to Oslo tomorrow. Collected R from the church. J + R then off to the Uni to pick up some old computer bits with E. I do some shopping, very very slowly, in the fruit shop. Happy to cook tea, water the garden and snip a few dead heads away. J + R now have a working, if slow, computer for around Â£6!
