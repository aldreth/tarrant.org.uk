Rose walked to dance on her own. Anna very poorly with persistent cough/cold. Applied liberal layer of choc icing to fudge cake before picking her up. Lovely afternoon at Lal + Pauline's celebrating their new garden + 1st WA. Lots of couples with small children, babies - felt quite old with our lot, especially T. Came hope relatively early because J+R tired out - got home just in time for Dr Who.
