We had Jane & Andy and Steve & Sam with Tom and Josh round on New
Year\'s Eve.

Cindy and I had spent the previous day and part of that day cooking
curries. We had lamb and spinach, tandoori chicken, black eyed beans
with mushrooms, aubergine and tomato, green lentil dal and home made
samosas. All lovely!

All the children stayed up till midnight, even Rose. In fact the adults
seemed tireder than the children. Toby, Tom and Josh would have stayed
up for ages longer.
