With great difficulty, tidy J's room in readiness for Swea. E + I decide to do some culture vulturing @ the galleries and have lunch out. Only make one exhibition in St Mary's. Strange suspended ceiling of fibre fill, couldn't help wondering if Boyes stock it in this width! Made me want to leap into the middle of it. Very good lunch at the tasting room - [see blog](/2005/07/06/the-tasting-room) - over which we lingered until pick up time for the children. Yoga time and I know I've had it so watch new drama with E.
