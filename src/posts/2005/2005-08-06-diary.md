Awoke feeling sick + was so before getting out of bed - just fluid. I think I must have been semi-conscious the whole journey interrupting my state only to retch in tissues. Dreadfully wretched and felt absolutely awful. (E thought, only for a split-second, that I had died!!) Managed to soak up the lovely sitting room for a while before retiring to bed. We have a lovely red room with most impressive Victorian style bedstead.
