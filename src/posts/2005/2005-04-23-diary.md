Dropped Rose at dance then rushed off to shop before dashing to M+L to paint gold on J+A's cake. T+I cycled to the registry office for simple, but moving, celebration. Jane cried. She looked lovely in red silk. Back to M+L for wine, speeches + good food. Toby + Tom fantastic as waiters and general dogsbodies. Lots of chat + food + wine + champers - all very very nice.
