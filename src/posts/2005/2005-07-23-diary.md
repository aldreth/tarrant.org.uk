L + M came for breakfast. L very stressed and didn't stay long. Has lots of work to do before going to Birmingham this afternoon. We all pack and leave. M stays as they have Norwegians in their house this week. Only one serious traffic jam on the way to Keswick. Children suddenly remembered the house on seeing it. All sort out rooms. We discover that we should have brought sheets. E buys a bulk lot from Oxfam - Â£22 not bad for sheets for 5. After a reviving cup of tea we head off for the lake. The water level is noticeably lower. R loses her new waterproof shoe in the mud, J fails to find it! Nice meatball tea. T + E chess. R + me mastermind.
