Finished off J's coat - looked good. Made him a hat - no wonder people buy these things. Took ages, but I enjoyed it.

Met L+M for lunch at Meltons on the the Resident's first deal. Very nice, but not a very inspiring menu. Nice to eat with L+M. L treated us - sweetie! Hour sit down at home before going to the thread painting at the Guildhall. Basically knew it - must get down to designing something + planning how to realise it.
