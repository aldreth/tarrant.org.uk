On Sunday evening there was a Taizé service in the Minster for the Week
of Christian Unity, or something, and Meeting had been asked to find
some \"young people\" to light a candle. Toby and Luke and Millie Holman
were asked and we all went along.

All the chairs are out of the Minster at the moment , and they had
arranged some in a big oval shape in the nave, around some icons and a
horizontal wooden cross on the floor. There was some (lots of) Taizé
chanting, a reading and then our lot lit the candle.

It was a really high candle, so Toby had a wick on the end of a stick.
The first time he tried to light it, he couldn\'t see the candle wick
and his long wick went out. He came back to relight it, he and Luke
barely containing their giggles, and fortunately managed to light it
second time round. There was an audible sigh of relief from the
congregation.

After that everyone light a little night light they had been given and
placed it onto the cross in the middle of the nave, until it had candles
right up and down it. Looked lovely.

The Minster was alarmingly **cold**!
