Set off on electric bike at about 8am!! No caretaker because it is polling day!! argh!! Borrow a mobile + phone emergency number. Get caretaker out of bed. Long + short, find bag when E phones my mobile - it's usually turned off for the lesson... what a relief! Enjoy a lovely day at the Forbidden Corner with J+R and Lance. I love this place - such fun. Great picnic of Thai style chicken in rolls + pork pie. Good fruit cake.
