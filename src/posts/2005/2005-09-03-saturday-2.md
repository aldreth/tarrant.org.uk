Boring title I know - never mind.

In the morning: Toby went off to play squash for the first time at York
RI. He\'s stopping playing football, so decided to find a new sport and
squash fits the bill well - local, indoor, so all year round, fast and
energetic. He had a really good session and is going again on Tuesday.

John, Rose and I went down to Bishopthorpe Road for shopping and sweets.
We bought back buns. I ate mine with Cindy while listening to BBC Radio
4 comedy - the \"[Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain][1]\" playing
Smells like Teen Spirit. Very funny.

PM: J, R & I to university for Einstein Day, about Rockets. Set off
stomp rockets and water rockets, and watched a solid fuel rocket go up
about 100m. Displays about the planets and telescope (we brought home a
make your own cardboard telescope) and two using liquid nitrogen to
demonstrate super conductivity. Fun.  
 Toby put his remote control car back together - still not sure if it
works though.

Evening: Rose and I went for a walk in the twilight/dark - across the
Millennium Bridge, up the other side of the river to Skeldergate Bridge
and then home along Bishopthorpe Road. Saw bats and had a good chat.
