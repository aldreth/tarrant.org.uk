Went to Harlech beach - about a 20 minute drive. It\'s a lovely flat
sandy beach, with views of Harlech Castle, the Llyn Peninsular and the
Snowdonia hills behind it. The sea was nice and warm - much warmer than
the North Sea.

John got quite badly sunburnt unfortunately, due to not having his sun
cream renewed often enough.
