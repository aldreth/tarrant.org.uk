We **all** (Jayne, Steve, Christopher, Pat, Maurice, Mandy, David, Amy,
Tom, Cindy, Me, Toby, John and Rose - Matthew AWOL) went out for
Jayne\'s birthday last night to a very nice Italian restaraunt in
Emsworth called Niccolino\'s. David had said that the portions were big,
but they were truly enormous. Really wide menu, very good pizza.

We all had a really good time, especially when the waiter came round to
help Steve sing to Jayne in Italian!
