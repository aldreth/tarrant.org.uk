More shopping for Dave first thing. Then into town to buy pressie for Amy. Went for a fairy, came back with lovely hand blown glass baubles.I hope she likes them.

Very low about my lack of breath. Felt back to where I was a couple of weeks back before treatment - could walk very short distance only. Can't believe - still - it's come to this. Lovely good work assembly for Rose - Goblin poem was fun. Bought new dance shoes for Rose. Nice mooch on our bed with Rose reading before buying Indian takeaway. D+E very worn out Dave has worked like a slave all week - has done amazing things this week.
