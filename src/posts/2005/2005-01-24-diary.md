Zipped along for a bloodtest after dropping John + Rose off. Sleety + very cold - even Toby was wearing his coat. Very nice Reiki with Robert. Lots of contact over my aching tooth even though I hadn't told him about it. Edward fried left over jackets which we had with a glass of wine - yummy! Very busy with Rose, Mimi & Eleanor starting sewing projects. A blouse for ragdoll Jane + 2 bird cushions. Tea with Tom then pyramid making with John - very nice pyramid. John's stuck a goggly eye on the inside - great fun.
