E + the boys leave at 7:30 for their date with Go Ape. R + I follow a couple of hours later. They all have a fantastic time, it certainly lived up to J's expectations. Brunch in the cafe and then all go cycling. I revisit Blackwell House travelling across Windermere by the ferry. T arrives home sporting quite bad grazing from a fall. All very tired.
