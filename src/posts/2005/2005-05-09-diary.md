Pick M up at 10 and enjoy drive to Castle Howard. E + I finally decide on a lovely back bamboo and large black flowerpot - very urban chic - and a mock orange. Had my eye on many a tree - would have quickly outgrown the yard. Lovely steak s/wiches for lunch with salad + wine to celebrate M+L wedding anniversary - cheers Lance who was off recording.
