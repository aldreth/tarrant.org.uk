Set off for Hunmanby about 11 and although traffic a little heavier than yesterday we had pretty much a clear run. We suits again proved invaluable - Rose didn't want to come home. Lovely walking along the beach - no gradient, felt normal. Fantastic view, air, breeze. So very very lovely. Best place we go. Pondered on the day I won;t be able to even walk along the flat. E drove home. Everyone tired + hungry. Went to see 'Downfall' with Jean - a deeply disturbing film about Hitler's last days in power in a bunker in Berlin - horrifying.
