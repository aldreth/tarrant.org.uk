Super Italian meal for Action Aid laid on by Luisa. And we did manage an Italian class afterwards. Toby to MacBeth with L+M + Tony - it wasn't very good (no interval to buy ice creams). E + I shopped on the internet for kitchen + spent nearly Â£2,000. Sore throat setting in - starting to feel very jaded this evening. E bad day, very low.
