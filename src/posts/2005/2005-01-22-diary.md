John enjoyed Nathan's b/day celebration of pizza + games @ Nathan's followed by Superbowl - he scored a strike. Toby very happy because E has helped him mend his car. Thank goodness it still works.

Rose happy with the dunagrees I've mad for rad doll Jane. Tomorrow a shirt and maybe start the coat with buttons.

Bumped into E in the market and we had coffee together. Lovely mussles with garlic for tea.
