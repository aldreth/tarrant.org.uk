John, Rose and I cycled this morning along the cycle track to Naburn on
the [Scarcroft HSP][1] cycle ride. Nice leisurely ride that we all
managed easily with lunch at Naburn.

Then this afternoon we went to see [Wallace and Gromit][2]. Excellent
film really enjoyed by all.

After a lovely tea of lamb chops for John and I and spinach and feta pie
for Rose, we went to pick up Toby from the station. He\'s had a lovely
time with Jane and Andy - really enjoyed himself and has come home full
of the joys of the big city! Lovely to have him back.
