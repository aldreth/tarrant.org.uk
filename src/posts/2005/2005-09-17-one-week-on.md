It has been a week since Cindy was last in the house. It seems so
recent, but things are so different.

Our lives continue though. I got new glasses in the week, I chose them
with Cindy about a week and a half ago, but she\'ll never see me wearing
them. Rose has gone away for the weekend with Yorkshire General Meeting
8-10 year olds to [Barmoor][1].

Toby went off with Keith this afternoon to watch Huddersfield [play][2].
John and I went over to Will and Sarah\'s, they cooked on the barbeque
for us.
