Not very energetic today. Very difficult to get up and very breathy. One of those days where I'd have difficulty remembering what I did. Tackled the 'piles' on the back table + E sorted out the sainsbury bill. One of those boring tasks that we've been putting off, but which makes me feel clearer + lighter when it's done. Mimi arrived and we did some tie & dye. Anita brought cherries, stawberries + cream! Drove J to gym club. Watched some exciting womenâ€™s semi-final tennis.
