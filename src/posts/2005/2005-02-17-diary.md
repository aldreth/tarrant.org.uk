Greeted Tobi - seems very nice. Nice pottery gift from Germany + chocs for R+J. Coffee with E + then home. Did lots of baking - puds + cakes. Kath popped round for a cup of tea with tales of overexciting trip to Spain last week - 1st anniversary of Marcus's death. Tobi to bed feeling unwell. Has had no supper. We're all worried about him, but hoping it's just exhaustion + possibly feeling a bit overwhelmed. More exciting day for them tomorrow - going to Bradford Museum of Film & Photography.
