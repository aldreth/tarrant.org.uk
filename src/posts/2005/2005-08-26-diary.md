Writing retrospectively and cannot think beyond a late morning again... Chris Hughes came about 11am and I managed to get dressed reasonably quickly. She had brought me a tarte au citron - really nice although I could only manage a little. Ted and Lily came to pick her up and Lily stayed for the afternoon + for tea. E does tacos, everybody's favourite. Manage to drive Lily home - it is an effort.
