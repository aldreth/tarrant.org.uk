Bit overcast today. E disappointed not to be walking with Will as planned. Go in staggered fashion to the Centre for Alternative Technology. A very gentle place and has the look of the rambling about it. Very impressive composting of various waste. J + R go with S + K + Tom to the farm at Harlech. We return home. J, R + T try out climbing harness up tree - great fun. Then off to stream for E, J + R. T assembles new aeroplane kit.
