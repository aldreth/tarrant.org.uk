T receives an award for academic achievement this afternoon. Also for punctuality and attendance. Very, very happy for him. He's worked hard and has really made the best of things - French possibly excepting! His report is excellent, one of the very best. Brings home his art folder, which is surprisingly very good. I hadn't realised he was so good at this - he always plays it down.
