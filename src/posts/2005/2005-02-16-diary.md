E at work this morning. Very busy morning shopping readiness for Tbi's arrival. Leave it for E to unpack as can feel myself running out of steam. Off to Italian with Mary leaving Swea to finish off cleaning - didn't make much impact on Rose's room. Cried off yoga and went to bed intended to get up to say hello to Tobi - didn't make it. Slept through to 4am + then had peppermint tea.
