Sea and I drove over to Castle Howard to shop for plants. Bit of a roan storm when we first arrived that soon broke out to an an almost steamy warm afternoon. Bought another fern, petunias, a hollyhock, herbs of various 'golden' names for M+D + a few other things. Had tea in the teashop & then set back. Lovely afternoon with Swea bought some plants + compost. Spent evening putting plants in, R had to drag me in for story.
