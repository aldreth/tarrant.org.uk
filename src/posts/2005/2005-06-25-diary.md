Relaxing breakfast of croissant and coffee before collecting R for dance festival in town. R + I speed along the river on my bike and meet up with M + D to watch Scarcroft School. Enjoy coffee + R a lemon sorbet at Capaldis before making our way home for lunch. Suit ourselves after lunch - Lily comes for rollerblading. Toast the new kitchen with bubbly + smoked salmon crostini and then sup at the Himalayan - great evening out.
