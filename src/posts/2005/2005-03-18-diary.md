Met up with Alison F for lunch at Melton's Too - had a very nice French Onion soup. Alison is very captivated by Jamie Oliver's school lunch revolution - as am I - and we chatted about this a lot. Popped to library before picking up children. Packed up and moved back home. House felt very damp. Not good for my sore throat.
