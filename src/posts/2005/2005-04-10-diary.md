H+D to Mass, J+R+T and me to Meeting. E doing some work. Toby got his bike sorted out by Josh Parker. Nice chat with Carol who I haven't seen for ages. E cooked us a nice salmon + mushroom pasta for lunch. E then off to Rotherham with J for gym. R, D+H and I over the river to look at some of the art on the open arts w/end. Dropped them off at the station for 4pm then R + I to the park. A great tree climber. J returns triumphant with the gold - fantastic! Me very sleepy on the sofa - could hardly keep my eyes open.
