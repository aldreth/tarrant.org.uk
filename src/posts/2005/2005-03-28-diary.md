Brimham Rocks gave us all a much needed 'run' around in the fresh air. Everybody had a good climb, although Toby has 'found fear' and was not leaping up stuff as he once used to. Oversized trainers did not help. Found the 'smartie tube' that Toby wriggled through in yr 7 on a school trip. No takers this time.
