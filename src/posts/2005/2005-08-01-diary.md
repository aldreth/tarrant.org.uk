Toby shopped with me at Sainsbury. Don't know how I would have managed without him - Â£150 worth! And he unpacked it all. E took J + R to the spy event at the Castle Museum and then to the Colour Fantastic in Rowntree Park - would have liked to have gone, but my energy failed me. Put together chilli + tacos with a fresh fruit salad for pud as Lance was coming for tea - all very nice. Lovely evening with E!
