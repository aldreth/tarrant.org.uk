Lovely summer day. Mary drove me to Vertigrow and I spent yet more money on the garden. Fantastic trees for sale, very much for the BIG garden - and wallet - and an enormous selection of plants. Spent the afternoon replanting the raised bed; took out the wall flowers and replaced with some nice grasses and some bedding plants. Audrey gave me a scented geranium and M gave me lots of tomato plants & some sweet peas. Looking really lovely. Poor J sick on and off all day. He's v. bored. R had a sudden black mood lifted after tea. She's decided to be a vegetarian.
