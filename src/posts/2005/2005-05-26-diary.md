Lovely warm morning cycling along the river. River watch for a while from the City Screen balcony. Excellent view here of ancient York - ignore the bad bits, namely the hotel. Chat with Cathy over coffee & then do a bit of market shopping. Back home to find E in very low spirits. Finish off the tea prep and then set off for 3:30 appointment. Straight in for scan, never got past 1st page in mags! Curious incident drinking a yogurt drink - man opposite stared hard at me + then asked to borrow a pencil, hurriedly sketched something, returned pencil + tore out piece from magazine most odd! Hope for tea - they have lots of snails!
