Took Toby off to help buy tiles + shopping. J+R stayed at home John in his pyjamas until 11 I believe! General party preparations amidst making lunch, tea, etc. Mary cycled John to the theatre and took the girls in the car. Just made it. Horrendous traffic. Good play - Snow White - a little young maybe. Nice pizza tea - Jo cooked the pizzas for us. B.day cake, passs the parcel + Kim's game. Gemma, Anna & Fran - all very nice. Washed up in new sink!
