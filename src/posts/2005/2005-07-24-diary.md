Start the day with a lovely boat trip around Derwentwater. Sun's out and the view of the surrounding hills is absolutely gorgeous. E + the boys get off at High Brandelhow and walk via a scramble to Catbell. R + I continue back to Keswick and then sit on the beach enjoying the sun. T buys a dingy and all enjoy it after tea - great fun. Tea at Brysons - much looked forward to on memory of our last visit here.
