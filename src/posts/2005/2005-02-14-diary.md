Nipped into hospital for blood test & then to Bishy Road for eye test - surprisingly no significant change, even though my short to long seems very slow. Nice lunch at new Italian with Mandy + Tom and a bit of shopping. Pick-up & then lovely sewing afternoon with Mimi, Rose & Eli. Edward seems to have had ok day at school - looks very drained. Tom for tea. All very busy.
