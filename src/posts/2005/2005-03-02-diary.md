Definitely need Toby to help me with my Italian - I think it could be really helpful if he did 10 mins with me twice a week. Shopped for Dave. Mary took the children to school, my breathing has been very laboured today, everything is very exhausting and the wheezing is tedious. Frustration in all I do today. Rose has made a lovely 'Smile' booklet - great fun. J+R great help with washing up & T with the ceiling. E exhausted.
