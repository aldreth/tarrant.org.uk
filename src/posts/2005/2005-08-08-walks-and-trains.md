Will, Toby, John, Rose and I set off on the Snowdon Horseshoe; Jane,
Andy and Mary went on the PYG and Miners trail to Snowdon; the rest
wanted to go on the train to the top. There were vague plans to try and
meet at the top.

The train was booked up until 5pm, so they went on a different train
around a lake. John\'s sunburn was really bad, so he, Rose and I went
down to a lake and waited till Will and Toby came down the hill. Toby
walked Will into the ground apparently, limitless teenage energy! Mary,
Jane and Andy did their walk as planned.
