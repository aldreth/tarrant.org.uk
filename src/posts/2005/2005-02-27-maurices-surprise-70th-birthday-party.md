Cindy\'s dad, Maurice, was 70 on Friday and we all met up for a surprise
meal. He knew he was going out with Mandy and David, but also there were
Amy and Tom, Janyne, Steve, Christopher (who\'s 20<sup>th</sup> birthday
it was), Matthew and Cindy and I. Maurice was very surpirsed and very
pleased!

Jayne had organised a fantastic gift for him. It\'s a voucher for him to
be able to drive a F1 racing car. Maurice seemed pretty overwhelmed by
this, and couldn\'t wait to be able to do it. Photos to follow once he
does it!

We had a nice meal in a pub near to where Pat and Maurice live -
followed by coffee and more drinks back at their house. Didn\'t get into
bed intil almost 2! Then drove back home this morning.
