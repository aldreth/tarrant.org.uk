I played badminton against Simon on Tuesday and John and Toby had a
game. They played together really well and John picked up a lot. Toby
has decided not to play football in the autumn, so he\'s looking for a
new sport to play regularly - he\'d really like to play tennis, but I\'m
not sure if there\'s a club with indoor courts. Maybe he\'ll end up
playing badminton at the RI.
