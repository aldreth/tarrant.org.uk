Decide on Humanby Gap this afternoon. The Campbells decide to go too and puc up Luke Holman on the way. The big boys all have wet suits and spend ages in the water on the body board. J+R brave the sea in costumes. J endures for longer. Great fun on skim boards. David builds a fire. Hot tea + coffee in flasks, chocolate, fruit cake, Lebanese bread + honey. Fabulous. Stay for a good three hours enjoying the fire, sun and lovely, lovely beach.
