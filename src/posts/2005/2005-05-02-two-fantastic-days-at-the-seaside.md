Bank Holiday Weekend - go to the seaside!

So we did. All the children now have wetsuits, so they can be in the
water for literally hours. I just got cold. In fact on Sunday, I didn\'t
go in the water at all.

We all took turns on Toby\'s body board, \"catching waves\" in the surf.
All three of them got pretty good rides.

John and Rose also have skim boards - for skimming across shallow water.
We all tried these out - Toby with great success, the rest of us just
about managing to do it. I fell off quite a lot, and as I was running
the sand was rather like sandpaper - bit sore this evening!
