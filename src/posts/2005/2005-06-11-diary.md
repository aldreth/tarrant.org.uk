Quite an effort getting up this morning - no T to buy us bacon! Dropped Rose at dance and headed back to have coffee with Jane. She checked missing guests on the patchwork squares of her dress. E babysitting for Jack + Grace and R having a sleep over with Lily. J + I watch Dr Who and then head over to spend time with E - the children were still up - Jack very miserable. Eventually fell asleep just before everybody got back! Lovely cake made by Sarah.
