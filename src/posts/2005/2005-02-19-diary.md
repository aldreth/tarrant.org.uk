Managing to get through fatigue + aches + pains quite well. E took T+T to the football with Keith this afternoon. John off to a party. 6 boys for tea + DVDs in the evening. E + I holed up in the back room. Met up with Joanne Smithells, Agnis Baskerville, Helen McDermott + Emma Thrussell in Bettys. Took J+R too. Lovely to see them + hear all their plans for next year. I really felt like I missed my job this afternoon.
