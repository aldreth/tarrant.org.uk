No girls for sewing - tired + ill. No Tom - he's grounded. John jumping around as usual - he has invite to a year 6 girl's party. Toby just about fitting in a bit of revision.

R not really wanting to go back to school - would not kiss me goodbye. E to Harrogate with Ted. Andrew - vicar at St Clements - pops in for tea, very illuminating chat about Cawood. Cath came for lunch - M's bean soup from yesterdays Betty's course - after fighting with her u bend for the best part of the morning. Spent lots on T at Millets for his D of E. Card making for M tomorrow + gym as usual.
