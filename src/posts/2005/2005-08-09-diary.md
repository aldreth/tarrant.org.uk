The children, E and others made for the stream this morning. Beautifully hot and sunny. I found a sun spot around the side of the house overlooking the downward slope of the garden. E had taken photos so that I could get a sense of where they had been. Made sandwiches and then M + our family set off for Harlech beach. Another big party to Portmerion. Beach wonderful. All enjoyed T's dinghy, including M. Very nice BBQ by K +S for supper. A back to London, J spending night in tent. Cards with J, R, K, G + me.
