Ask T to take me out to the Gallery. He pushes me along the river. E, J + R go by bike. T enjoys the nice polished floors for pushing me on - he can get up a bit of speed. Nice exhibition on the Forest. After a drink in the cafe he takes me home. It is so nice to get outside and good to spend some time with T. Phil + Marcia arrive and E cooks a very good noodle supper. I manage to chop a few veg.
