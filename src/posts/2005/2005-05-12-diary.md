Hoping to go to Anita's with Rosie Waring to look at hat production but poor girl could not make it out of the house. Judith eventually persuaded her to go with me and have a look at my sewing machine. She did some stitch samples and I showed her how to do applique in silks. Felt desperately sorry that she cannot go anywhere, meet anybody without feeling a deep anxiety. Arranged to go with her to Boyes tomorrow.
