John read his Big Toe radio report - very exciting. Dance for Rose. E did shopping & Jean came round for coffee in the afternoon, also Jane who's here meeting wedding caterer. Viking battle in the afternoon - very cold. Mandy & Tom arrive about 4. Lovely to see them. Nice fish in tomato, olive sauce for tea, rhubarb fool - E's speciality, very nice.
