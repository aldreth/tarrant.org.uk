We went to the York Castle Museum to try out their August activity.
Followed a booklet around, looking for clues as to who was the spy
finding out secrets about the Rowntree\'s chocolate factory. Good fun
and it made you look more carefully at things you might otherwise
ignore. There were a few characters dressed in period costume who
introduced activities that were fun, including one solving a code that I
couldn\'t work out! We found the spy in the end.
