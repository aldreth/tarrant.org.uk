Decided to stay home + cook Sunday lunch. Such an effort on the breathing front and pain in my chest. Feel very low, slow and cheesed off. Nice lunch with L + M. Luke also joins us. Cathy phones + invites Toby sailing - he's very happy to go. R goes off to the park for an hour with Caralan, watch in pocket + strict return time. E for a walk, L + M to the park to listen to the band. Return for a cup of tea. Cycle R + Caralan to her house. Caralan has a lot more 'freedom' and I'm trying to work out the best way of letting R have her friendship while maintaining my peace of mind. T returns exhausted, but having had a great time. Feels + is sick later in the evening. Watch men's final - Federer wins, of course! Snip + trim in the yard, cul snails. Feel shockingly miserable in bed - breathing just seems so rock bottom - doom + gloom mood... poor E!
