We\'ve been to Hunmanby Gap again today. Some skimming, some body
boarding.

John jumped off a submerged rock into, over, through waves for half an
hour. They both hunted for fossils and found several [\"Devils
Toenails\"][1] and Rose found a nice [ammonite][2].

Toby\'s just got home from his weekend and has had a good time, not too
exhausted, all quite easy apparently, although another group managed to
get lost, gave up and sat down waiting for help!
