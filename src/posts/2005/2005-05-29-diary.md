A slow morning and then over to Mum + Dad's via the back route - very pretty countryside. Children enjoyed running around the garden. After lunch we walked around Prinstead - largely unspoilt. Lovely reedbeds back from the shore. Would love to walk the whole perimeter of Chichester Harbour + resolve to buy OS map for M+D. Later ask Dave if he has one - not to hand! Amaze myself at how little we got to know our locality as children + wonder if my children will feel the same about Yorkshire. Certainly feel cheated that we can't weekends now,, just as all of them would now walk. Sigh.
