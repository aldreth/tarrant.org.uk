Toby and I went out today to the Knavesmire to drive his new car which
was finally in good working order - after new batteries, new glow start
and a tune up in the local hobby shop. It went really well - fast,
jumps, skid turns...

And then I had a go. Drove it into a wooden post and broke the
suspension on the right front wheel!

Toby was devastated, obviously. I felt really guilty and annoyed with
myself. We\'ve spent the rest of the afternoon with the manual finding
part numbers of the broken bits so I can order them all on Monday. They
should arrive next weekend.

Arggh!
