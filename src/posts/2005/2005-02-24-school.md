A lot to catch up as I haven\'t posted for a week.

My first week back at school was fine - lots of observation and group
work. The children seemed pleased to see me and I enjoyed myself.

The second week was up and down. Monday was fine. Tuesday morning was
good, but Tuesday afternoon was dreadful. I felt right back where I had
been - then I stupidly stayed for a staff meeting and must have been
obviously miserable. Wednesday though, was really good. I had an
excellent science lesson that all the children enjoyed. Andrew, the
deputy head asked me to think about what I had done to make it better,
but really I don\'t think I had done anything particularly different. I
was as well prepared on Tuesday as I was on Wednesday, and in fact
Wednesday\'s lesson was what I\'d tried to start on Tuesday. So - good
that I had a good lesson and I must try and stay positive through the
bad ones.

Next week I\'m in school on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - Thursday
and Friday by myself.
