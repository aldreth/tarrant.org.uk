I had a very slow Sunday morning, despite thinking I might have gone to Meeting. More washing! Went to Chrissie + Jonathan's for a BBQ - met up with her nephew James + his wife Gillian, small daughter Gemma. J + R loved playing in the garden and discovering the frogs in the poind. T opted out and went to the cinema with Luke. As James + co left Margaret + David arrived - people from Sheffield we have met before. Had a really nice afternoon. Beautiful sunny evening despite rest of day being dull.
