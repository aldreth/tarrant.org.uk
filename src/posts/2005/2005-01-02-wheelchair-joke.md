      Hi you guys!! we found out about your site from Lance when we visited Kat
      & Simon New Years day - we had a great time.  It was fun to see Tom and
      Jack together - Jenny and Katharine were comparing 'baby notes' a lot of
      the time. It was good to use your site to catch up on news - it's a bit
      slow percolating through these days, especially since L & M are so far
      away. I'm impressed with all the activities you all manage to fit in, but
      sorry to see that Edward is off work with stress. As a fellow teacher I'm
      not the least surprised. I can honestly say that switching to supply was
      the saving of me - friends had commented that I had become a different
      person (not in a good way) and that I am visibly more relaxed and more
      like I used to be before teaching took over my life (literally. I'm
      currently doing supply at a little prep school and some tutoring for a
      Year 7 girl who is waiting to get a place in a school.

      We had a lovely Christmas - the first one I've enjoyed since starting
      teaching!  We had lots of family time and did several walks. Heather had a
      gig for New Years eve in a local pub, so we supported that then dashed
      back to a friends party to celebrate 2005 arriving.

      Hopefully we'll get to see you sometime soon - we're coming to stay with
      Helen & Andy 1st weekend in Feb and hope to visit L & M so maybe we can
      meet up.

      love Kath Richard & Heather

We went to Bridlington today with Mary. I enjoyed getting out in the
fresh air, it wasn\'t quite as cold as it has been.

We took the wheelchair for when Cindy got tired of walking. Toby was in
it for a while. To start with I pushed him wildly and spun him round.
Then when we\'d got tired of that, I pushed him sensibly for a while.
When an elderly couple were just walking towards us, he got out of the
wheelchair and I turned to Cindy in amazement and said, \"I told you the
sea air would do him good!\" I don\'t think the couple were convinced
that anything miraculous had happened - particularly as we were laughing
like drains.

In fact, Cindy laughed so hard she had to sit down in the wheelchair to
recover!
