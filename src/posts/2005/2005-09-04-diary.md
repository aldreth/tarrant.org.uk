E went off to Meeting with John and Rose. Toby put his car back together. Dressed and sat in my chair. Experiencing some pain. I took some pain killers which make me feel very lightheaded. Michelle came with Betty's cake and lovely juice. E makes us tea and we sit and chat. Start to feel very nauseous. Jo bobs in and I have to send her away to be sick. Just as E brings up nice roast lamb! J + R enjoy swimming. T goes off over to Luke's. Fall asleep v. quickly - exhausted with a rather erratic breathing day.
