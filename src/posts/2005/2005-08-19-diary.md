Mandy's 40 birthday today - send her a text. She is coming later and I'm really hoping I'll be able to join in celebrations. Have spoken to Kate Hodge (MacMillan nurse) + she's going to get Dr S to come and see me so that we can get on top of the sickness. Mandy + Dave, Tom + Amy arrive. Mandy still in the dark about birthday treat. D says he was taking her to a campsite. Book into the Marriot in time for all to enjoy leisure suite. E + I have fabulous room with balcony overlooking the racecourse. I think this is on account of the wheelchair. Lovely meal in the evening. Good food, wine and excellent service. A wonderful treat from Dave for us all and I think a memorable b/day for Mandy.
