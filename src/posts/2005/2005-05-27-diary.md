Horror - a snail or slug has eaten one of my hollyhock leaves - I'm setting up a barricade of eggshells.

Carol has some amazing ferns in her garden, along with a carpet of ble forget-me-not like weeks. It looked like a wild woodland. Drank coffee with her and Claire and then back vie the Blakeshead for a lovely lunch with E. Assembly for J + R. Finished off cooking for Mum + Dad's do around tea time. M came for E + I to go to the theatre 'Gluey + the Lion' - really excellent. Glass of wine + chat with M. Super day.
