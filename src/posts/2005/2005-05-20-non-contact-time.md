We went to the West Yorkshire Playhouse to see the third of the plays
that we\'re seeing on the big deal. It was [Non Contact Time][1], a play
written by a primary teacher about life in a primary school. It had some
very funny, well observed moments, such as a chorus of \"Pens down. 5 4
3 2 1. Let\'s see who\'s ready. Well done, well done, well done. Who\'s
letting us down?\" Lots of laughter of recognition from an audience that
must have been mostly teachers! The story, particularly at the end
seemed over dramatic and tacked on.

The play was only 90 minutes long, so we were home nice and early. Jean
had been babysitting, and only John was home. Rose was out at a sleep
over and Toby is away for the weekend on his [D of E][2] expedition
training.
