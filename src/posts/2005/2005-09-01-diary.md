With O2 walked to + from the loo around 6am. Felt I'd turned a corner. Then smack back. Had to get there pretty quick around 8-9 and had terrible breathing episode. E wheeled me back eventually. Tried again around 11:30 + had to call for M. Disappointed - poor all day. E took all fossil hunting near Brid. M came and made me coffee. I could hear the hoover and I think she's done a touch of cleaning Jools came with Freddie - 10lbs now and very bonny. I held him quite a lot, it was very nice. Lovely chatting to Jools - my day is much nicer if somebody bobs in. E back about 5 - they'd had a good time except for Rose getting her fingers trapped in the boot. Long chat with Mandy and Dave.
