All have gone to Hunmanby today. It is the first outing I've not made. Feel like I've been in bed forever already! Mick and Joolz phone and will visit next week. Have got back on course with my knitting, written to Annette, played loads of patience, looked at photos and listened to the radio... now what? Think I'll try and muster the energy for a bath.

Mary came round and made me coffee and roll. We sat in the yard and had a bit of a weep. All came back weather beaten and E made a very nice fish pie for tea.
