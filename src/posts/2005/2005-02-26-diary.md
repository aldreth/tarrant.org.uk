Departed pretty much as planned and good journey to M+D. Met up with Jayne + Steve, christopher + Matthew - both looking very grown up. Chris 2- today. Chatted over drinks in the bar & waited for Mum + Dad. Both were very surprised to see us all. Dad quite gobsmacked with his racing car voucher! Jayne had placed balloons on the table + once the heating was on it was a nice table. Food nice - my starter a bit mean. Back to M+D for coffees and fell into bed about 1am. A very successful evening.
