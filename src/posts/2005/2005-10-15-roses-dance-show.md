Rose\'s dance show has been taking up a lot of time the last few
weekends and I finally got to see the finished thing tonight. I was
amazed. It was very good indeed and Rose looked very grown up in her
various costumes (flower, sailor and spoon!)

Rose has got exhausted with the dress rehearsal last night, and then two
performances today, so I hope she\'ll have a bit of a lie in tomorrow.
