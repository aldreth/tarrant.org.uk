Carol + Claire came this morning for coffee bringing a large piece of fern from their garden. This will shield the bin nicely. Met up with Helen Cadbury for lunch at the Blakeshead - very nice pumpkin soup! Dashed into Borders to buy Chrissy a notebook and pen for her birthday. Dropped Rose with Anna at the youth club - their first visit - and then headed off to L + M for pre-dinner drinks. Very pleasant sitting on the terrace. Raced off to No 8 and met up with Chrissy + Jonathan, Roger + Jo - very good meal. L + M to J + R for an Indian meal.
