Yorkshire Sculpture Park in bright sun and clear sky is lovely. Have never been here - it was lovely particularly the Henry Moores situated in the middle of a grassy field. Fantastic new gallery building - one side completely grass. An area dedicated to childrenâ€™s workshops is tucked away in a wooded area and had a very large white rabbit - thought Rose would like this. E had to push me up the hills in the chair - very breathy today. Lovely lunch of tom. basil soup in the cafe. A lovely day out together.
