T poorly this morning - didn't even do his paper round. Generally very exhausted from all his activities over the last week. Me very slow getting up Feeling not too good. Once up felt much better. Cool + raining. Cycled in and met Cathy at Betty's. Helen Cadbury came too. Nice tea, scone + chat. Dug out some fabrics for Jo and did a few embellishment samples before going to Deborah's textile club. The hour went really quickly and we were both busy solidly as the girls' confidence grow + they've speeded up. Lauren + Nathan for tea - surprise arrival of Caralan. Popped over to Jo with fabrics, lots of coughing + clearing my chest - think I've been ill
