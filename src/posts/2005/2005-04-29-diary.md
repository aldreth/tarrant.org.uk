Rose good work assembly. She did not look - and indeed was not - as though she was enjoying it.

West Yorkshire Playhouse for David Copperfield in the evening. Very slow. We both nodded of at intervals. Very interesting set revealing a stage that goes back far further than has ever been revealed. Jean babysat.
