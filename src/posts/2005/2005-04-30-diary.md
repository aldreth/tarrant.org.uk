Coffee with Jean after dropping Rose off for dance. Then drive Toby to Keith's and have a quick cup of tea with Judy. J+R to the dance show with Bill leaving E + I with an afternoon. Cycled into town to buy fish and then watched Grand Designs - very decadent afternoon behaviour.

Nice salmon for tea followed by family viewing of Dr Who. Have started embroidering Jane's guests signatures.
