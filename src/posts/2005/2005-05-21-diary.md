Bob into town while E takes J off to dance. Bump into Richard Ogden deliberating over asparagus + have a long chat about veggies + the markedt! Collect R on the way back. Bake a pear flan, while E takes R + J to the park. Drive J to Emilyâ€™s birthday party at Water World. He was the only year 5 invited - he later told me he 'coped + had a very good time'. Lovely meal with Judy + Keith - gravalax, Thai style steak + pear tart. Judy brought me a lovely pot stuffed with herbs.
