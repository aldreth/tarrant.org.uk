Say goodbye to James. Toby to Luke's, John + Rose to Meeting and then to Oscar & Lil's. Phone Kate, L + M, message on Jane's machine. Mandy coming up. Pat + Maurice - will phone Jayne. To hospital. C very calm, quiet. On nose oxygen thing rather than mask. Syringe driver, drip off. Read to her, stroke her arm, face. Nurse Tina said she had response when first on shift 7:15, I don't see any. Read paper, reminisce out loud. Go down for lunch in cafe. Back to C, talk, read paper - notice C very quiet. Still breathing just. Tell her I love her, we all love her, will miss her. Stops breathing 2:30ish.

Go to Luke's 3:30ish. Tell Toby - cries, hugs, wants to see C. To Chris + Ted. J + R back from swimming. Talk in garden. V tearful. Ted takes us to hospital. We spend hour or so saying goodbye - Rose takes daisy chain for C. Lovely idea. Home. Mandy + David arrive + go see C. Cathy brings soup, Chris made pudding - thanks. Phone people. Pat + Maurice + Jayne arrive Travelodge about 10. Have to tell them on phone. 1:30 v tired can't sleep, green tea.
