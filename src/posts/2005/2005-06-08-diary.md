Sorted out pack up for T and tea in readiness for Dave. Bobbed into town & bout T a german phrase book & OS map of chichester for Dad. Met M and cycled to La Piazza for Italian meal. Really nice and I think we will try and meet again - managed to speak a bit of Italian. R off with M via Nok's 'jumble sale'. Just E + J for tea as I was feeling v full from the Italian. Very quiet without T. E saw him before he left. Nice yoga building up to moon prayer. T texted me at 11:30 - 'nice family'.
