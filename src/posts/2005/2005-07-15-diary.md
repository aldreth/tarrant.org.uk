Saw Dr S this morning to discuss the nature of my demise - so this was a jolly little meeting. Feel happier now and realise that so long as everybody talks and plans there really is no need to lie and gasp and suffer. Having know Dr S for so long will, I think, make everything much easier for me and everybody.

Onto sports day - how I missed a good running race. Can't see that the children raise their heart beat one iota. E played badminton. Me gentle afternoon - still recovering.
