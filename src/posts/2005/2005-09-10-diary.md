Jean to sit with Cindy AM - Cindy's request. Rose dance, Toby paper round + squash. J + I tidy his room. PM to hospital via town. New watch for J, ballet shoes, piano music. Cindy lucid, difficult to understand, dry mouth, breathing v laboured. James to stay overnight. Stir fry. I go back to C 8-10, phone Cathy & Chris. Then back again after talking to Helen on phone. Cindy very restless & Uncomfortable from time to time. Given more morphine and sedative. Home 2:30.
