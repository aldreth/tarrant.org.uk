Although overcast it is not raining and the little rainfall we have is while we're in the car driving to Cockermouth. Visit Wordsworthâ€™s birthplace. A wonderfully restored 17th century family house with cottage garden. Plenty of eager staff on hand, some in costume explaining the ways of the day. E + T leave us on the way home to walk to Skidaw. J + R + I play several games of the Twits. Off to the cinema this evening.
