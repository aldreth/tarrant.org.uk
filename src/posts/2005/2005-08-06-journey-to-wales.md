Saturday - time to go to Wales.

Cindy woke up not feeling very well, but we loaded the car up and left
anyway. The journey to Ffestiniog was about 5Â½ hours, with Cindy sitting
throwing up fluid every half hour or so all the way. In spite of that it
was a surprisingly good journey, with the children all being fantastic
and Toby map reading very well.

When we arrived, we unpacked and Cindy went to bed. Jane and Andy had
already arrived; Katharine, Simon and Thomas arrived at almost the same
time as us; and Lance, Sarah, Will, Jack and Grace, who had all been
camping, arrived soon afterwards.

The house is lovely - very large, spacious bedrooms (8 of them), big
sitting room, well equipped, slightly run down kitchen and amazing
garden and grounds. The children all ran around working off their pent
up energy, while Andy and Jane cooked a lovely meal.
