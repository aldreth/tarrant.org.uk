Had a hearing testing today - all ok barring a slight niggle that they will keep an 'eye' (ear!) on. Started the morning with an hour steaming and sitting in the jacuzzi at the Living Well centre - thank you Judy. L + M picked us up at 5pm for the W Yorks playhouse to see 'Lion, Witch + the Wardrobe'. Lovely tea and super production with great set + costumes. Everybody really enjoyed it.
