\- where does the week go?

The problem with writing several days at a time, is that I can\'t quite
remember what I did when! However looking at my diary -

Monday - supermarket and in the afternoon to Millthorpe with John and
Rose\'s classes to see *Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat*, their
Christmas production. Excellent. As Toby has been so uninterested in
this sort of thing, we\'ve had practically no idea it\'s been happening,
but there are obviously lots of opportunities for singing, dancing and
acting. Some of the main parts were pupils in year 8, so that could be
John in 2 years time! It was also good for John to have another chance
to get into Millthorpe, so it isn\'t so unknown next year.

Tuesday, I saw Ted briefly, before having coffee with Alison and then
lunch with Lance and Mary.

Wednesday - John was off school, and Rose was off school today - so I
had to cancel badminton with Mark again. Oh and I went to the pub with
Steve on Wednesday evening.
