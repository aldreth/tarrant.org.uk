Scan this morning. Then a bit of retail therapy. Home for lunch then off for our big treat. Fabulous room in the loft. Dark furniture, large french bed and a pool table. Delicious big bath. Settle in the lounge with Tio Pepe, olives and very hot fire for an hour of so. Leisurely bath trying out smellies before supper. E has a bloody mary in the bar + we are served scampi soup + mussels as a taster for things to come. Order mushrooms, spinach + quail egg on a crostini for starter + woodcock for main. E a pheasant risotto + steak on rocket. Croze Hermitage 2001 to drink. Too full for pud - shame. Coffee + chocs + access to some cheese in the loft - which was magical and plush. Lovely, lovely day.
