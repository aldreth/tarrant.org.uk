Rosie cried off - she wants to spend time with Judith before she goes off on holiday. Went into town with E to buy present for M + took advantage of book offer on Design C20 + Architecture. Lovely afternoon so sat in the yard - which really is looking very good at the moment. Anna ill, so Rose decides not to go to youth club. Goes to Nok's for sleep over. Tom here for sleep over.
