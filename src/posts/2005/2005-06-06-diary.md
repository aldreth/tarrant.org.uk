E busy DIYing in the kitchen ready for Dave. Did very large supermarket shop - felt quite exhausted, spending £130+ - leave E to bring in the heavy stuff. Girls arrive for sewing and decide it's much too nice to stay in so we head off for the park with the skate board. Suddenly feel much better trigger off by lovely view of the millennium bridge and seeing the girls laughing so much. Man goes over handlebars unexpectedly. Go to meditation group - lovely ride back at 10pm along the river.
