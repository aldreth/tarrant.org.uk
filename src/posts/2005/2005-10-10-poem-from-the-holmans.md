      Edward,


      What a lovely poem.


      When we are next up, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know where
      Cindy's ashes were scattered.


      Regards,


      Phil...

      Edward,


      If you are serious about the Trowbrige music festival then their site
      gives the dates: www.trowbridgefestival.co.uk.

This poem is one that the Holmans chose to read at Cindy\'s funeral, but
didn\'t find a space to.

> The Dead
> 
> The dead are always looking down on us, they say,  
>  while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,  
>  they are looking down through glass-bottom boats of heaven  
>  as they row themselves slowly through eternity.
> 
> They watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth,  
>  and when we lie down in a field or on a couch,  
>  drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon,  
>  they think we are looking back at them,
> 
> which makes them lift their oars and fall silent  
>  and wait, like parents for us to close our eyes.
> 
> Billy Collins
