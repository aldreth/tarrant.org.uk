John went to dance this morning, Rose was picked up from her sleepover
at 11:30 - absolutely exhausted, very little sleep I think. In the
afternoon we went down to the park, played hide and seek in the waist
high cow parsley - absolutely impossible to find anyone. Later on in the
afternoon, John went to a party at water world, and Rose and I went to
see Anna in hospital (she\'s got pneumonia, poor thing, but seemed much
better today.)

Keith and Judy came round for a meal in the evening. We had fantastic
steak with chinese spices, noodles and pak choi. Biggest pieces of meat
I have cooked for ages, ever perhaps 8oz steak each! Too much really,
could have half as much meat, twice as much veg. Absolutely delicious
though.
