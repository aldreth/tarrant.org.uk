BEACH!

Get ourselves together after breakfast + Mandy makes a picnic. Stokes Bay is sunny, windy and pretty empty. Set up 'camp' on the beach. J + R straight away make for the water. Dave, E, T + Tom play boule. Windsurfers, sail boats + ferries aplenty. Absolutely gorgeous. Soak up more sun in the suntrap at the front of the house before supper.

Long, but steady drive back, roads surprisingly empty. Fall into bed about 11:30.
