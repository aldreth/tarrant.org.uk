Stunningly hot day. Me a very slow morning, but with mention of the seaside managed to get myself up. It was well worth it, couldn't bear the thought of lying in bed all day and missing out on Hunmanby. Tide was 1/2 hour short of high when we got there. Feasted on chips for lunch before descending to the beach. Every body swam, <ins>very</ins> hot. Lovely, lovely day. Could have stayed longer, but children hungry. Lovely fish supper. T a cinema date with Katie - think it's his first or at least the first we've known about. Lucky him - very exciting. Have lived to see it - another milestone met.
