      Edward,

      Marcia and I were greatly saddened by the news of Cindy passing on and our
      thoughts are with you, Toby, John and Rose.

      I am so grateful that she honoured us with her friendship and feel humbled
      by her bravery and dignity.

      Cindy was a fantastic friend and a lovely person - we will remember her
      with fond memories.

      She lives on through your children and for that we must be grateful.

      Your friends.

      Phil and Marcia

Kate Hodge our MacMillan nurse came round today, to chat about practical
things. She\'s sorted out some extra painkillers for Cindy. Cindy wanted
to have some available, because she\'s worried about things getting
worse at the weekends when everyone who knows her is unavailable. Kate
is also going to sort out a care plan for other weekend eventualities,
so Cindy doesn\'t end up in hospital unnecessarily.

We also wanted to talk to Kate about what benefits I should be claiming,
now that I\'ve finally finished being ill at Cawood. It seems it\'s a
good thing we spent all our savings on the kitchen! I\'m going to claim
for income support and carer\'s allowance. Income support is based on
Cindy\'s income too, so we\'ll see what we get!

This evening I went to a Year 6 parents\' evening for John\'s class. We
were filled in on plans for the year, what and when the tests are, and
lots of info about Sex Education (growing up) and PSHCE - which sounds
fun. John seems to have settled in really well and has decided he likes
Mrs McClure following a chat about [Malorie Blackman][1], whose books
John is really enjoying at the moment.
