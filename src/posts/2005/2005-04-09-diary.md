J decides to give dance a miss and comes into town with me after dropping Rose at dance. We buy fish + then head back again. David + Helen have arrived on return. Toby's b/day he opens pressies in bed ritual on return from paper-round. Tom, Josh & Alex come for FnCs, DVD + X box game. Squeeze in sparkling + crostini + salmon supper with H+D. Hectic, but lovely day. So very happy too see Toby 14. Dave leaves 5ish after v. v. busy day.
