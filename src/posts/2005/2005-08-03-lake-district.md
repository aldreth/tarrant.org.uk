We had a fantastic week in the Lake District, staying in Keswick.

Some of the highlights included:

Scrambling up a waterfall to the ridge on the west of Derwentwater, and
running for half an hour from the top of Cat Bell to make sure we got
the boat.

Go Ape - high ropes through trees followed by mountain biking all
afternoon.

Tea at Bryson\'s in Keswick! Yum yum.

Swimming and playing in Toby\'s new inflatable dinghy in the Lake.

Card games on a rainy afternoon.

Fish and chips - more food.

A good time was had by all.
