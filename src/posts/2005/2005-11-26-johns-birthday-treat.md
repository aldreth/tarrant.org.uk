It\'s John\'s birthday next Thursday, and he decided to have his
birthday treat before his birthday. So last night he had 5 friends (Tom,
Robert, Nathan, Jean Luc & Livvy) round for tea and then went on a ghost
walk.

For tea we had burgers and chips (his choice honest) and then a
chocolate cake from Roald Dahl\'s Revolting Recipes cook book. It was
Bruce Bogtrotters cake - the one a child has to eat all of in Matilda.
It was incredibly rich and really rather good.

We went out on the ghost walk at seven, all wrapped up in coats,
scarves, gloves and coats as it was so cold. Unfortunately we didn\'t
have any snow here, unlike other parts of the country. Everyone enjoyed
the walk and didn\'t get too scared - it was story telling rather than
full on scaryness. We came home and had more chocolate cake and warm
drinks, and everyone except Tom went home at 9:30. Tom stayed for a
sleepover, and went home as I took Rose off to her dancing this morning.
