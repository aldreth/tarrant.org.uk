Everybody slept late this morning - especially Toby. He then spent most of the day on his Geography homework, it took me ages to proof read. Dave, E and J went off to the cycle rally. Mandy, R and I sat in the yard. We fiddled about with the fountain and have finally arrived at a satisfying bubble. Cooked a roast chicken dinner + Mandy bought chocolate cake + eclairs. M + D set off for home after lunch dropping J + E back at the cycle rally. R + I cycled into Shiva to buy the tea light star holder she had her eye on. Had a little wander down the Shambles because she didn't want to go home. Finished sorting out her room - she has set up a little hidey den under the bed. J glad to be back in his room. E has found a job to apply for. Lovely warm day. Yard really looking lush in the evening darkness as I watered this evening. Nice to have kitchen back. Need to finish tidy up tomorrow.
