Had hoped for a return to the improvement I felt on Wed this morning, but it was not to be. E took the children out shopping for school things this morning and then he and the boys to badminton. Judy came this afternoon with large bag of magazines. J + R busy with their rooms, Toby too. Judy helped out with the hoover for R. As Judy left Jo popped in with news of her camping at Bishopthorpe and teh offer they have put on a house. Amazingly felt quite tired must have fallen asleep about 10:30.
