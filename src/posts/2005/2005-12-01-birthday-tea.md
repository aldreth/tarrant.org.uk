We had a chinese takeaway this evening, by special request. Katharine
was here, and so were Lance and Mary. Delicious meringues for pudding
(in spite of being spooned out)!

We finished off the evening by playing John\'s new board game - [The
Simpson\'s Game of Life][1]. Enjoyed by all. And **I** won!
