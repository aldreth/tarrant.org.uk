Official unveiling of the children's wall hanging at Meeting this morning. Brenda has made a great job of it. Left Toby + Rose still sleeping. J up at 7am as usual! Lunch finishing wedding feast at M+L. J+R played with the hose + T off to play football. Went to Carol + Nick's wedding. Packed out and a very nice Meeting. Nick's mum read the Gilbran poem that I recognised from our wedding. Sun still in the yard when I got home so made the most of it. Old kitchen going tomorrow so will be able to spread out more.
