Mandy took us to Explosion a surprisingly interesting museum about guns and fire power at the old gunpowder factory on the Hard. J + R enjoyed themselves and we picnicked overlooking the harbour before going home. T stayed with Tom + played on the mini-motor. Out for an Italian with all to celebrate Jayne's birthday. V good, huge portions. Singing Italian waiter for Jayne.
