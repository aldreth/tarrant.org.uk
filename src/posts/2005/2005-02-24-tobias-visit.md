Toby\'s German exchange - Tobi - went home on Wednesday. I think that he
had a good time. He didn\'t eat very much, but according to Toby, his
friends said that none of the visitors did! If that\'s all they eat in
general Toby is going to be ravenous when he goes over there in June.

At the weekend we went to watch Huddersfield Town play a [match][1]
against Blackpool. It was very cold, but I think we all enjoyed
ourselves. Toby normally goes with Keith Emerick, so this was the first
time I had gone. The people around us in the crowd were what made it
interesting. In the evening a load of Toby and Tobi\'s friends came to
our house for pasta and video.

On Sunday they went round to someone else\'s and played football and
XBox. Monday after school was ten pin bowling, then on Tuesday Tobi went
home.

Busy few days.
