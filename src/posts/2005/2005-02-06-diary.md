Lots of ministry in Meeting. Josh Parker - very full of despair - very sad. E took John to the cinema and Toby went along with Luke and Jordan. Rose to Mimi's. Quiet afternoon doing some Italian and finishing a cushion cover. Lance round for supper. Anita phoned to say Rose wanted to stay for a sleepover so will pick her up tomorrow. Feel particularly frustrated today at my lack of energy, would so like a good brisk walk, a swim, a run, anything really than endless sedentary activity. C'est la vie!
