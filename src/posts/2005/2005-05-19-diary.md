Anna is in hospital with pneumonia. Buy various fripperies for her. Jo is constantly at her bedside + sleeping on a camp bed. All very traumatic. J +R concerned. I think the seriousness of it has sunk in slowly. Lovely coffee break in the yard with E. He's worked all day on the small kitchen window. Collect children + cook fish supper. J to gym + T to cinema with Andy to see the new Star Wars movie. Bob to M + L to turn of washing up machine - bring home lovely flowers. V tired this evening + a bit wheezy.
