Awake with a pulled muscle in my left side that hurts when I cough. So, move around gingerly all morning. Jo brings R back and then E takes her + Anna off to Harrogate for Miss Yeowart's wedding. J stays with me + beetles around - tidies his room. M phones + says there's lots of blackberries on the allotment. Cycle him down there - it was a huge effort because of my muscle. He cycles home himself. Sick again later in the evening which leaves me feeling wretched.
