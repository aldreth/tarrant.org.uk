Phil, E, R + Claudia set off to do the breadcrumb trail and J, Lucas and Marcia to the Railway Museum. Manage to bathe and get up in time for lunch with Marcia. E + co return much later having lunched out and picked up cakes at Betty's. T very disappointed not to be sailing with the Holmans. Too much wind. I retire after tea and cake. Don't have the strength or appetite for tea.
