J+R very tired - wonder why!

J off to gym for 10am. R slumps on sofa and doesnt want to go to Meeting, so leave her with Toby and go alone. Levely meeting. Ministry from somebody: comment on lack of visual demonstation about asylum @ Friends House. B Windle quick to remind about work going on behind the scenes - lively! Residents 1st weekend. J+R+E+I go on river trip + visit Barley Hall. Interesting yarn twising in B Hall that R+I come away with. T f/ball - lose again! Quick supper then off to Taize Service in Minster - T just saved himself from a fit of giggles in the considerable effort it took to light the candle.
