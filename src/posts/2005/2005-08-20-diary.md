Quite a difficult morning getting up, I think because of the having to get up and be down for breakfast. None the less a glorious sunny view across the racecourse. Fabulous choice for breakfast, I plumped for smoked salmon, trout, roll and fresh fruit salad. Dave took full advantage! Pre-dinner sparkling wine + crostini in the garden. Dave has bought Mandy a lovely ring - same place we bought her bangle. Then a lovely evening at La Piazza. Fantastic watching Mandy's face as the Happy Birthday serenade went up + she suddenly realised it was for her! A lovely evening with all the children there - they really enjoy going there.
