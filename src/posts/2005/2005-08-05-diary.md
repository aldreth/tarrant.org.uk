Dad's Thruxton visit today. Lots of hanging around for J + R but the weather was kind. All had turned out to watch him speed round in a mazda, some MG model + a single seater. He really enjoyed himself and has had a DVD made, so will be interested to see this. All back to M + D for supper. T enjoys Tom's mini-motor again. Can see this being his next purchase. Had to get to bed - not feeling too good. E goes in Porsche.
