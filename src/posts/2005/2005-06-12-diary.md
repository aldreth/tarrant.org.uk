Very quiet in the house with just John. Start to make picnic + then cycle to Meeting with John. Doing Fox Group - we do something on treats + make cornflake crispy cakes. John had found the 'Chocolate Cake' poem for me on the internet - one of my favourites. Enjoy a lovely Meeting House picnic at the retreat with Martin Ward's usual treasure hunt enjoyed by all children, a rounders game, Chris H.'s tour of the retreat and Bone's history walk. Judith showed us how to make flower garlands.
