School has finished for a week. We\'ve no major plans - seaside
probably, some making no doubt.

John is out at a fancy dress party at the moment. Cindy spent a lot of
yesterday and this morning making him a pharaoh costurme and he does
look super in it. Just before we left to go to the party he had to check
that he could cartwheel in his costume.

Rose got back a short time ago from her friend\'s house, where she\'d
been for tea. When she\'s out of the shower I\'ll read her the next
chapter in [Anne of the Island][1] - her current bedtime book.

Toby is out at Southlands Church Youth Club, where he is helping out as
part of his Duke of Edinburgh award. He didn\'t think there would be
many people there, as a lot of them are at the same party that John has
gone to.
