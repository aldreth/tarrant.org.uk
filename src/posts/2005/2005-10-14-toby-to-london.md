Rose and I went to the station to wave off Toby. He is spending this
weekend in London with Jane and Andy. It\'s the first time he\'s gone on
a train journey by himself, and although I was sure he would be ok, it
still felt very strange watching the train pull out with him in it.

He was met by Jane at Kings Cross so all was well. On his journey, he
texted me several times, so it\'s not even as though I didn\'t know
where he was!

Rose went off to a dress rehearsal for her dance show *Alice in
Wonderland*. So it was just John and I at home - very quiet indeed.
