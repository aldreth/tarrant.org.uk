Very hot again. J + R enjoy Bill + Jo's new paddling pool for a couple of hours after dance. Really hot again. Bake some tartlet cases + fill with creme patissiere + nectarines and take to Judy + Keith's BBQ. Meet up with Alison + David who we met at Christmas + their 2 children Kirsty + Brody. Really nice evening and good supper. Judy's garden looking lovely. Newly installed - by Keith - waterfall into the pond. Very impressive.
