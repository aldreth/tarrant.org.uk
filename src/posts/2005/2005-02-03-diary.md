E in school this morning. John has diarrhoea and looks grim. Toby too and looked even worse, still did his paper round + went off to school. Very stoic and driven boy. Kept John home. Popped into town when E cam home and bought fabric for John's fancy dress. Spent best part of the evening on it. Parents eve for J+R and look through their work - all in good order. J's mental maths very good. Rose's writing coming on nicely.
