Still felt intoxicated in Meeting! Moved into the Mount and celebrated with roast dinner. Great to have some veggies. Nice to have some room, access to washing machine etc etc. Lovely home made cards from all the children for Mothers day. Phoned my mum for same plus Amy to wish her happy 18th. Sent lovely glass balls as pressie.
