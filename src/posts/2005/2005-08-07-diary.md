Felt better today, if rather weak. Found the beach at Harlech. Great expanse of golden sand bordering a beautiful blue sea. Dunes. Castle. Fantastic. Spent pretty much the whole day here. E had to carry me up the sandy slope and push me along the path. Still recovering from yesterday! Helped put together a large roast lamb dinner - excellent leg purchased by Lance. Good game of cards in the evening. J v sunburnt + uncomfortable.
