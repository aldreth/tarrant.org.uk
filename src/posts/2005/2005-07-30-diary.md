Cinema didn't happen. Played some cards with R. E and the boys watched a TV movie. Managed to get up reasonably well and help with packing everything up. Went well and the children were very good packing the boots. Home in time for lunch. General unpacking + washing this afternoon and then went to Matthew + claire's party at 6pm. Really nice social occasion and lovely food. Left quite early because the children had had enough - fair does.
