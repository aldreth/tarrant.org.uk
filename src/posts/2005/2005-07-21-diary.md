Today I went to Whitby with Sam. A lovely breezy day. Arrived ready for our first snack at the Shepherds Purse. From there Sam pushed me round to the harbour and out onto the pier. Without the protection of the harbour the sea was rough and exciting. The children would have loved to get out in it with the body board. Returned to the Shepherds Purse for coffee and then made our way back to the car. A really lovely day chatting with Sam. We always have a nice time. M for tea.
