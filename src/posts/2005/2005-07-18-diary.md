Feeling so much better this morning - woke with some energy which makes me realise that I have actually been rather ill. A slowish day and then to the final textile club with Debora. Receive surprise thank you card, choccies and voucher for Pextons to share with Deborah. Have really enjoyed supporting her with this club. D is very inspiring, very organised and really nice to work with.
