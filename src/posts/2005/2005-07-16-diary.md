Dance as per usual and then R invited to Freddie's to play. E + J off to the Palmours for a Tour de France party. T off into town so I had a quiet afternoon. Went to Katie's daugher's wedding reception in the evening with R + J (T with head in new Harry Potter), J took Harry Potter with him. chatted to the Palmours. Didn't stay long as T on his won. Watched a bit of Jeeves and Wooster.
