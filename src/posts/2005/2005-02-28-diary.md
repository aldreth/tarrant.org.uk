It's very bad! Ceiling's down, gas cooker gone... everything gone in fact so no meal here tonight or for quite a few weeks. David + E worked well into the evening. Had the girls over for sewing - bird cushions looking lovely. Rose has finished hers. Sausage + mash at Granny's then picked up FnCs for the men. Dust is awful making me wheeze like an old boiler. Everybody coughing. Lunch with Helen Cadbury.
