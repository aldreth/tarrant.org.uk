Appointment with Dr B this morning. L collected J to take him to his scuba diving + R dropped off at the craft activities. I was feeling very nauseous + just managed to sit through consultation - was sick outside thankfully. Straight to bed on getting home and an afternoon of complete oblivion. Felt as bad as I have in a long time, couldn't even drink anything and my O2 levels felt very rock bottom. Didn't want to be left on my own for too long. Sat up until about 3am and then drifted off to sleep.
