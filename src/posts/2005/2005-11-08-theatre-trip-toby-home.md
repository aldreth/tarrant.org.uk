Toby\'s been off school today - dreadful cold, headache and runny nose.
He slept for over three hours in the middle of the day, so he must have
been worn out as well. He still feels rather ill tonight, so I\'m not
certain he\'ll go tomorrow.

I went with Rose\'s class to York Theatre Royal this morning. It was
great. A very interesting tour with talk of ghosts, sailors backstage
and pantomimes. Both sets that are up looked good and I came home
wanting to go to both plays! Rose enjoyed herself as well and has been
much better today in general.
