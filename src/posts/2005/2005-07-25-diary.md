Very late morning. Finally manage to get out and walked along the lake where the wheelchair could be pushed. Quite a short walk, but nice to feel out and about. Had a sandwich sitting by the Lake and then did a bit of browsing in town. Sat in the garden in the afternoon. Very nice Cumberland sausage for tea. Stone Circle in the afternoon - make vague plans to return and watch the sun rise!
