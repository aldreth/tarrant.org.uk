John Rack came @ 11am for coffee. Has had a serious throat infection that saw him in hospital for 5 days. He was still looking quite grey and scraggy. Still trying to talk himself into justifying his behaviour and a belief that everybody is ok with what has happened except for Debbie. It's all very complex + tortuous + he goes round + Round (as D does when I talk to her) and probably will for a good time to come before he blows himself out. Spent a good hour cutting out clothes for the girls. They spent very little time on these and instead preferred to play outside - which seemed the far better option given how sunny it was and that they've spent all day inside. Walked around the park with J + R after tea - very cold wind. Stroked Chris + Paul's dogs - Amy + Florrie - very sweet dogs.
