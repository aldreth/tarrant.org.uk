Rose has been at home today. Worn out and miserable this morning. We
went to the supermarket together - as we had **no food**! After lunch
Rose started tooting on the flute Sam has lent her. She\'s going to
start lessons this week, and John is going to start saxophone lessons
once his instrument we\'re getting through the council arrives.

Went into town with John and Rose to get John some outdoor shoes and buy
music for sax and flute.

Rose managed to get to sleep quite early, and Toby, John and I watched
[Much Ado About Nothing][1], the first in the new [BBC Shakespeare][2]
series. Really enjoyed it. Toby and John are both doing Shakespeare at
school, so they knew all about him!

Off with Rose\'s class in the morning to go back stage at the Theatre
Royal. Should be interesting.
