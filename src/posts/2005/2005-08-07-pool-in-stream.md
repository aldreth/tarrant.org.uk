We walked down to the stream in the grounds and found a waterfall with a
fantastic pool at the bottom of it. The pool is deeper than I am tall;
big enough to jump and dive into, and have a swim of about 3 strokes
across and 10 strokes round. Rose was first into the water, as she
slipped, then John and I went in.

Water was **freezing**!
