      Hi Toby - the truck looks good!  how's it going and have you let dad have
      a go yet?  I bought Steve a radio controlled super mini cooper (nothing as
      huge as yours!) for christmas, and it kept him busy for ages! the only
      thing is, our animals are not so keen on it as it whizzes around the
      lounge and diner at great speed!  hope you continue to get enjoyment from
      it and good luck with any future ebay purchases! lots of love,  Jayne

Hey Toby here. Been fidilling with car over the last week or so and
today it got its first sort of run. I\'ve had a few short ones in the
alley before, a minute or so, just to test the settings. This evening
though I took out the front and drove around the street. I took it up
and down and jumped it up and down the pavement, great fun! Grandpa, Dad
and John watched. It still isn\'t going its best but nearly there.
Hopefully going to go down to the knavesmire tommorrow and give it a
proper drive.

Todays, was only about five minutes, but it was dark and I didn\'t want
any cars to come and crunch it. I still haven\'t let the car hit top
speed yet, there isn\'t enough room on our short road, I don\'t think it
has even hit 2nd! Hopefully knaversmire will go sucessfully and dad can
have a go. Well maybe a short go! Hope you like the pics, just a few
quick snaps of it in my kitchen. Update you soon and maybe a few pics of
it on the knavesmire.
