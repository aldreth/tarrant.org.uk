Very heavy rain for our departure. Me very breathless today. See a doctor in the afternoon to check for infection - as usual he didn't really know what to do. Enjoyed a pasta tea and actually felt hungry. T had had IKEA meatballs and a bacon butty on the way home with L - what a surprise! Lazy TV evening plus 'Chicago' on DVD.
