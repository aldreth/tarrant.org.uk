Met up with Chrissy for lunch @ No 8 - good old chin wag so much so left myself short to do the shopping. R off for a sleepover with Freddie and T going away for D of E weekend in Rosedale. His pack looked worse than it felt. Weather outlook looks good for him. Glad he's getting a good physical weekend after the exam season. Drive over to the Courtyard to see 'Non Contact Time' as part of our Big Deal - much better than D Copperfield. J enjoys having Jean to himself.
