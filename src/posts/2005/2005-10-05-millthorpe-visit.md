John has been off school today with tummy bug, but he was well enough to
go round [Millthorpe School][1] in preparation for moving up next year.

He recognised lots of the pupils who were there, which made him feel
better the change - not that he seems worried. All the pupils were very
chatty and seemed well balanced enough! I think it\'s really difficult
to tell what a school is like from the outside though. Toby seems to get
on well there, so...

All Saints next week, but I should think it\'ll be Millthorpe for John
and Rose - there will have to be very compelling reasons if not.
