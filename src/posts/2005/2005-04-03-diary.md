Rose in a 7am to open pressies. All on the bed including the cat. All to Meeting - kicked off with the Pope. Toby + I did feather icing biscuits. Took Lily home on the footplate of the bike. Enjoyed Rowntree Park's Green Play Day. Helped Mandy tidy the yard - looks much better. Dave + Mandy tiling. E + I took children to the allotment for L+M's bonfire. Like a warm summer's evening
