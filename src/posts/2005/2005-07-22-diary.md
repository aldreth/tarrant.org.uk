Pop down to the allotment first thing. T is helping M move some manure. I manage to pull a few onions. Given another go at things I would definitely like to have an allotment. There is a wonderful view of the Minster from the top plots. Also a good one from Millthorpe school I noticed on Tuesday. Spend the afternoon cooking for the holiday. Bob out with E and have a spending spree at Carolineâ€™s.
