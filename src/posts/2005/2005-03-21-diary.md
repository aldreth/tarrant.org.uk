Terrible night on the breathing front. I have a cold and 'woke' labouring to breathe. Oxygen mask a must. Felt quite frightened for a while, just about managed to persuade myself it is a <ins>cold</ins>. Took myself off to hospital + picked up more antibiotics, up the steroids + cough mixture. Slow, slow for rest of day. Highlight - watched 'Some like it Hot'. Great movie. T not very impressed although he did laugh quite a lot.
