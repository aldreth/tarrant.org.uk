Bit of a shop + sort day. Feeling quite breathy still, sort out T's DofE bits and pressies for Fathers Day + and Jack, L + E's birthdays. R off for a sleep over and visit to the pub - feel very uneasy about this one - E checks it out. T off with rucksack for DofE weekend. J, E & I go to Batman. Very nice to go out just with John. Enjoy drink in the bar before the film. Good movie. York as busy as we've ever seen it at 11pm with Ascot revellers.
