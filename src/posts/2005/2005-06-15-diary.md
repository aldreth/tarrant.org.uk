Manage slightly early rise this morning. (Cat loves new cat bed.) Tidy round in time for Swea + do some Italian. L + M for lunch. Cold + drizzly for our trek to the races. Park bike far too early. Stark realisation of how limited my lung is. I feel v tight chested + it is a huge effort to get to the railings enclosure - fantasise about my dear electric bike! Great fun watching pack of race horses gallop by. We lose Â£8. M is the only one to back a 'placing'. J has had good time with Claire -cooking. T on computer and R out at a party. Great day.
