Was going to go to Whitby, but very dam + cold and still not feeling very good. Moochy day. All pretty much suiting themselves, ie T + I as J, R + E off to London for John's Big Toe prize of tour plus tour round TV programme Exchange. M took T + I out for a lovely curry at the Himalayan. Then a cosy TV evening at Mary's until E phoned for pickup from station.
