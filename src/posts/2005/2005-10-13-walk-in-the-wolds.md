I went for a [walk][1] in the Yorkshire Wolds today with David Campbell.
We left after dropping children at schools and drove to Kirby Underdale.
It was about 8Â½ miles round trip from there to Thixendale and back. The
weather was a bit grey and misty, but it didn\'t actually rain! In
Thixendale we looked at the building that used to be a youth hostel,
that I stayed at with Will about 7 years ago. It\'s now heavily
renovated, looking much better and is used as a village hall.

This evening John and Rose have been out to Stomp, a very exciting
percussion/dance show with all the Emericks. They came home at about
9:45 very excited and hyper. I have been out to the Scarcroft pub quiz
for a bit - with Kjartan comparing the quiz. Shame I won\'t find out the
answers!
