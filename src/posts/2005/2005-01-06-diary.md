E & I enjoyed a morning in town doing a spot of shopping and then went and had lunch together. It's been ages since we've had time alone. Bought some lovely wool to start my next project - have to stich up the black slash neck before I can start this lot. Enjoyed Danielle Palmour's drinks party for her 40th.
