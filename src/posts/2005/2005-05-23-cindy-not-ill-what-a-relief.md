I was a bit worried about Cindy last night as she went to bed very early
with a temperature. She woke up today feeling fine though and has been
ok all day.

We spent most of the day chatting to John Rack who we haven\'t seen for
ages. Ellie and Mimi came round after school to sew with Rose - not much
sewing was done, more playing in the sunshine.
