I\'ve just got the children into bed after going out this evening to see
[Steptoe & Son][1] at York Theatre Royal. Rose and I went on a tour
round the theatre on [Tuesday][2] and liked the look of the set.

We all enjoyed the play, Rose didn\'t get too tired out and everyone
needed pittas and muffins when we got home. The set was great - a very
crowded \"totters\" front room, which opened right out at the end to
allow them to depart on their horse from the back.

The play was about the death of father Steptoe (can\'t remember either
of their names - was one of them Harold?) at the hands of his son after
years of provocation. The son comes back to the house, which has been
preserved by the National Trust, as an old man, and meets the ghost of
his father. Most of the play is flash-backs through the two men\'s
lives.

Most of the rest of the day was spent stuffing envelopes for the latest
[Lammas Records][3] mailshot. Lunch with Lance and Mary.
