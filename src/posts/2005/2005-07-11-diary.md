Enjoyed a very nice Reiki - Robert has expanded more in minerals - gave me a couple of stones. Retrieved my knitting before joining Deborah for textiles. Only one week left. J to Nathan's for tea. R to buy trainers with E. T had first day of activities week with a walk in the Hole of Horcum. Manic search for my rail card - still can't find it.
