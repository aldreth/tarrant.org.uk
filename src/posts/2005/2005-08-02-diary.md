Finally got around to making a dressing gown for Laura doll with rose. Rose did most of the machining. She is very good now + can thread the machine without any help. She also - again without help - baked a brownie. Settled bills and made phone calls in readiness to depart tomorrow. E took T + J to play badminton and then to the park. A beautiful day. Had dreadful muscle spasms this evening - about 4 in sequence, very painful.
