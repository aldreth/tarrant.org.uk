No rush this morning. Enjoyed tea in bed and a lovely bath. Fantastic waking-up in this lovely room, forgot where I was for a second. Fabulous breakfast around the enormous round table. Have bought goodies in the deli before heading home across country. Have had a fantastic surprise and lovely for E and I to be completely alone together.

Italian - good fun. Yoga - slept through most of it.
