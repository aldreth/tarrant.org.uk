Hunmanby Gap with M. Met Will + Sarah + the children there. All skim boards + body boards well used. Tide coming in - further up the beach than we thought. Eventually moved because of rain. V hard for me getting up the hill now - very sad! M + R off on a walk - R returns weeping thinking I might have left without her even though she knew I wouldn't - the thought just took her over! E + I to the theatre 'Players' - excellent really enjoyed it.
