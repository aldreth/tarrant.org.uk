Had to swap seats with Jack on the drive to the Snowdon railway because of car sickness - he was not impressed! Lovely scenery. Train fully booked so we satisfied ourselves with the Lakeland railway. Jack and Grace enjoyed themselves. Had a snooze on the return journey before Sarah + L took them to the stream. Walkers arrived back about 6. J +R hadn't walked so E had spent the day sitting by a lake - at least it wasn't raining! J + R camping out again.
