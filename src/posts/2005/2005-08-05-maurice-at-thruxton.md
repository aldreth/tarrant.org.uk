Maurice used his birthday present today - a driving experience at
[Thruxton][1].

He went round first in a Mazda RX8, first a passenger, then as a driver.
Then he went round in a single seater racing style car. He was really
good and overtook a few other cars.

There were loads of amazing cars there that you could pay to have a
drive in. I was amazed by how interesting I found it!
