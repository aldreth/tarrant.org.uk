Woke about 5:30 still feeling the same - so disappointing. E helps me wash and I get dressed to sit in the chair. I keep slipping down the bed and have started getting niggly aches and pains from being in bed - can do without that! E takes J + R down Bishy for shopping - Toby off to play squash with Andy - includes some coaching, not bad for Â£2. He also had a piano lesson yesterday. So he's all set up. E to the uni with John + Rose for Einstein Day. I chat to Anne O'Hanlon on the phone - she's really into sailing with her family. Speak also to Phil + Michelle - she's coming tomorrow. Looking forward to E's curry.
