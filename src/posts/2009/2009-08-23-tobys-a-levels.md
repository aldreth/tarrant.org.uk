Hooray!!

Toby got his A level results last Thursday. He got an A for Geography, B
for Biology and B for Chemistry. It was a grade lower than Sheffield
University had offered him for medicine, but they decided to have him
anyway!

Hooray!! Toby\'s going to medical school.

He\'s decided (in the last couple of weeks, while the rest of us have
been away) to have a gap year, so at some point soon he\'ll be off round
the world. He doesn\'t know where he\'s going yet, but definitely hopes
to have Christmas in Australia with Will and Sarah -- on the beach no
doubt.

Amazingly proud of him of course. Well done for all the hard work Toby.
