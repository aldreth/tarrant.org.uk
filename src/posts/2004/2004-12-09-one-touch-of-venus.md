Cindy and I went to see this [musical][1] at The Grand, Leeds. It\'s by
Kurt Weill with lyrics by Ogden Nash and apparently has never had a full
performance in this country, and has not had one in the states since it
was first performed in 1943. It had really colourful costumes, great
songs, good dancing and some slightly rude jokes. An excellent evening
out.

We went on the last preview night, when tickets were half price. This
meant that seats in the dress circle were affordable, instead of
extortionate.
