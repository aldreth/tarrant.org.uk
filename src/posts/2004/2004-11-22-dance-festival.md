John\'s Saturday morning dance group were part of the city\'s Dance
Performance yesterday afternoon. His group had prepared a dance based on
Hilare Belloc\'s [Matilda][1] - a poem about a girl who told lies about
fires and so ended up being burnt to death! I really enjoyed his bit -
the whole lot was thought up and choreographed by the children, with
lots of help from Janetta no doubt.

As usual there were lots of other good dances from primary and secondary
schools from across York. It\'s really interesting looking at the
different range of types of dance and level of skill that\'s going on in
schools
