I\'ve just got back from driving over to Immingham, the port on the
other side of the Humber from Hull, to pick up a [monster truck][1] that
Toby\'s bought off ebay. It\'s huge, expensive and he\'s very excited
about it. It\'s about 3 months of saving his paper round money.
Apparently fuel is Â£7 a litre!!

I\'ve never been over the Humber Bridge before, so there was another
excitement on the trip.

No doubt we\'ll fit in a drive at some point tomorrow.
