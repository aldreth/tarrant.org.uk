So during the last week in February Cindy went into York District for
her second session of chemo. We were hoping that this would be as easy
as the first lot when she was in an out of hospital very quickly, but
unfortunately it wasn\'t.

Cindy eventually came out of hospital after ten days - during which she
was the worst she has ever been. It turned out that she had had a chest
infection which was treated with antibiotics, but for a while things
looked very bleak indeed.

After a couple of days she was moved to a private room on a different
ward - which was better because the children could go and visit her.
They don\'t like going into the normal 6 beds wards, because they are so
full of sick-looking people. Cindy gradually picked up and eventually
came home. She was still very weak and extremely tired.

One good thing that has come out of it, is that she has been given a
nebuliser, which helps a great deal with her breathing. She\'s now able
to go up stairs without wheezing.
