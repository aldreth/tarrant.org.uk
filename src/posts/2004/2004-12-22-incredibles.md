We went to see [The Incredibles][1] last night, or more like yesterday
afternoon. It was really good. The animation is so good that some of the
scenes just look real. But more importantly, the story was gripping,
well told and exciting. Like too many films at the moment it was a bit
too long though. Not as too long as LOTR - thank goodness - I don\'t
intend to ever sit through the extended versions!

Just before the cinema, Cindy went to the Arc Light Hostel to deliver
her puddings and two other peoples food, and found the short walk from
the car to the kitchen, carrying food, exhausting. She said it took
about half an hour in the cinema to recover.

Children are hyper with anticipation at the moment.
