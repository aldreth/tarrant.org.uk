After what feels like an age of apply for jobs and not getting anywhere,
I\'ve got a job for next September at last! It\'s full time,
**permanent** and close to York - [Cawood][1].

Not only is it a job, I think it\'s actually a good job. It\'s quite a
small village school, (info [here][2]), 150 pupils and 5 teachers plus
headteacher, teaching assistants, and so on. It seemed like a very
supportive school, with lots of community links. It also had a good
[Ofsted report][3] and looks good in [league tables][4] (for what
that\'s worth).

Now all I\'ve got to do is survive the rest of the term at my current
job - I\'m off tomorrow to the Lake District for three nights/four days
with the class, which I\'m dreading!
