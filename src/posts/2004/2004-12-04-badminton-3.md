I played Simon again at badminton yesterday, and for the second time in
recent weeks, beat him. For his peace of mind, I should probably say
that it is unusual for me to win, normally its quite close but he wins.
Anyway we had a really good runaround and went home hot and sweaty.

Cindy and I are off to Melton\'s tonight with Jane and Andy. Looking
forward to it enormously. Cindy has been in bed for part of the
afternoon, so should have plenty of energy for staying up late.
