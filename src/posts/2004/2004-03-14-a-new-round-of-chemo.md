Early this year Cindy had a routine scan to see how she was doing.
Unfortunately it showed that the tumours had grown, and Dr Bottomley
recommended that she started back on chemo.

It is the same type of regime as before, with (generally) one night in
hospital every three weeks, and the other drug pumping in constantly
through a central line.

She went into hospital in early February to have the line put back in
and have her first lot of treatment. All went amazingly well, and she
was back at home on Friday, having gone in on the Tuesday. She recovered
from this first treatment extraordinarily well - which was good, because
I started full-time work at Wheldrake Primary towards the end of
February.
