Edward is deep in SAT\'s land this week with light relief provided by a
very nice art project creating a pattern using felt that will culminate
in a banner.  
 he has about 4 applications in at the moment and is having a week of
doubt that a job is ever going to happen. Something will come up soon
I\'m sure. We all had a busy weekend and Edward took John and Rose to a
music event at the Early Music Centre on Saturday for a show of Indian
dance, poetry and music. Greatly enjoyed by all. He then took them all
off to Meeting on Sunday while I helped katherine put the finising
touches to her puddings for the 40th Wedding Celebration of lance and
Mary.
