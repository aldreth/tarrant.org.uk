We\'ve just been to Arkengarthdale (in Swaledale - Yorkshire Dales) with
David and Anita, friends from Meeting, and their two children - Jordan
and Mimi.

We had an excellent time roaming on the moors, playing games (Great Game
of Britain and Perudo), bird watching, stream damming and - particularly
in the case of the boys - staying up very late.

Jordan and Mimi are strict vegetarians, but David and Anita seemed to
enjoy having a sausage and a little bit of bacon!

The children did an Easter Egg hunt and had a large amount of chocolate
each.
