It\'s been ages since we added anything, so here\'s a general round up
of events of the last month or so.

Cindy is off treatment and is generally feeling fine - she\'s got a cold
at the moment, so is rather breathless, but it should go soon.

Edward has finished at Wheldrake, to his great relief! The last few
weeks dragged like anything. Now he\'s starting to get ready for his new
job.

The children are enjoying the start of the holiday.

In late June we had a fantastic party at Lance and Mary\'s. It was on a
Sunday afternoon, we had about 100 guests, Cindy had done lots of
wonderful food and everyone drank quite a lot. Perhaps it should become
an annual event.
