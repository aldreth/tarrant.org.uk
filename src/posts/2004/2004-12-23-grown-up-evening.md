      Thanks for a great time,the food and company was superb. I was a bit
      disappointed that we didn't get on to house prices though...!


      Many thanks again to Edward and Cindy.

Last night we had Jo & Bill and Michelle & Mark round for a meal. We had
a fantastic time. Lovely food - crostini and olives, goats cheese
soufflÃ©, fish stew, diplomatico (an Italian chocolate pudding), cheese,
coffee and chocs. Very over the top.

We also drank well, in particular the dessert wine was luscious.

The children were fantastic - watching Strictly Come Dancing to start
with and then more or less putting themselves to bed. It makes things
much easier now they are more grown up.

We chatted till about 1:30, with not too much concentration on house
prices and school politics - although Jo did reveal that Mrs Cornhill
sent Kjartan a thong following his Magic with Pants gig and Mark was
proud to show off the new [website][1] he\'s done for the school.

Cindy took a couple of photos - here they are.
