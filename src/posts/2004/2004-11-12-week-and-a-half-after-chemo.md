Cindy is doing fine, but is absolutely exhausted. Today, all she has
managed to do is pop out in the car with me for an hour or so to look at
kitchens (obviously we only like really expensive ones). She has had a
long rest this afternoon and so far is doing ok this evening.

This version of chemotherapy is much better because she doesn\'t throw
up for two days after each dose, she doesn\'t have a Hickman Line, she
doesn\'t have the continuous infusion and **she doesn\'t throw up for
two days each time**.
