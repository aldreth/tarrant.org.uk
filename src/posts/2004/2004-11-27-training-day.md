All the children had a day off school yesterday, so after a lateish
morning (for me and Cindy, anyway) we went into to town and had brunch
at [Meltons Too][1]. John had a full english breakfast, with bacon,
sausage, 2 fried eggs, black pudding, lambs kidney, mushrooms, grilled
tomato and a grilled muffin. It certainly filled the plate, looked
delicious and was all eaten up (Cindy had the kidney, and I had most of
the mushrooms). I had scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, Toby had a bacon
and egg butty and Rose had a big piece of chocolate cake. Much enjoyed
by all.

While Cindy took the children home, I dashed off for my regular game of
badminton with Simon. He won again, but it wasn\'t the awful walkover of
last week. 2-1 to him with the last game very close.

Cindy went to bed when I got home, John and Rose made cards, Toby
pottered and then had to go to the dentist to have his brace tightened
again. The dentist says that he should be able to have his brace off by
Easter next year.

In the evening we watched Shrek 2 and kept nice and warm indoors.

Most exciting of all - John got a Blue Peter badge.
