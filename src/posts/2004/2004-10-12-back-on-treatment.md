After a few weeks of gradually getting more wheezy, Cindy has had
results of a scan that show she needs to go back onto chemotherapy.

It is a different sort this time - [Docetaxel ][1]or [Taxotere][1].

She is going to have 6 lots, with three weeks between each session. It
only needs her to go into hospital for a couple of hours each time and
shouldn\'t induce the sort of vomiting she had before - thank goodness.

It\'s disappointing news, we had hoped it would be longer before she
needed to go back onto chemo, but we\'ll carry on trying to take each
day as it comes, and enjoy what we can!
