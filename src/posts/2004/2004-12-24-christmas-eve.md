Last few preparations - present wrapping, turkey delivery (thanks Mark -
who got up at four and got ours as well as his), a party this evening
and carols at Meeting. Rose is doing a reading at Meeting, which will be
brilliant. We\'ve also got to try and fit in driving Toby\'s car this
afternoon.

Currently putting Cold War technology to good use by [tracking
Santa][1].
