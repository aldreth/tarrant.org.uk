Have thought a lot about whether or not to write you all a letter each for when you are older. This is because I am feeling very much like the best breath is draining out of me as a serious wheeze seems to be setting in and my energy is failing. Now this may of course be yet another re-run of the treatment taking its course and I will be 'bouncing' around again tomorrow. Or at least sometime soon. But I'm afraid I cannot dispel this doom + gloom feeling every time my health goes in this direction.

So what would I want to say to you all that you do not already know.\
Can I possibly say what I feel in a letter.\
How much do you all remember.
