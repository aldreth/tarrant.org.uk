I\'ve been signed off sick for eight weeks by my doctor - stress. It
takes me from half term to Christmas.

It\'s a relief really, as I wasn\'t able to concentrate on work at all.
Now I\'ll be able to think about the important things - Cindy and the
children. I\'ll also have time to sort out in my head how we\'re going
to work things in the long run.

I\'ve sorted out the medium term planning for the half term, and can now
try and forget about school for a while.
