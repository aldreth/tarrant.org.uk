While Cindy was in hospital for her second lot of treatment, there was
an amusing incident with a young doctor.

The doctor was listening to Cindy\'s chest, to see if there was sound of
congestion or infection. She kept moving the stethoscope from one side
of Cindy\'s back to the other - for quite a long time. Eventually I
said, \"Do you know she\'s only got one lung?\" to which the doctor
replied, \"Oh, that would explain it.\" She then disappeared -
presumably off to tell off a nurse for not filling her in on this useful
information!
