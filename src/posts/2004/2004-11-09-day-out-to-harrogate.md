After I\'d dropped the children at school, Cindy and I went over to
Harrogate to the [Turkish Baths][1] (recently renovated). I really
enjoyed it, as always, and spent a lot of time in the steam room and the
plunge pool. Cindy, however, found it too hot, too exhausting and spent
her time either in the coolest dry room or relaxing on the day beds. We
left earlier than we might have done otherwise, but it did mean that we
arrived in Betty\'s just before the queue started.

We had a lovely lunch, as you can probably see from the photos - rosti
with smoked salmon for her, and rosti with scrambled egg, mushrooms and
tomatoes for me. We walked back to the station and then arrived back in
York just in time to pick up the children.

In the evening, I took John and Rose over to gym, where I bumped into
Saffron - Nok has joined the same gym class as Rose. So I was able to
chat for an hour instead of sitting reading, much more pleasant.

And after that, Sam came round to babysit for a couple of hours so Cindy
and I could go out to Gill\'s fiftieth birthday party. It\'s difficult
to believe that she is so old, she certainly doesn\'t seem it. I suppose
that 50 isn\'t that old nowdays. Chatted to people about the oddest
things - Cindy\'s electric bike, reliable garages (Clive Hartley if
you\'re local and don\'t already know), drumming and various other odds
and sods.

Very nice day all in all.
