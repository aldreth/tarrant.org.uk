So busy enjoying life have had no inclination to write anything here.

Keep say to E that I haven't written anything down.

Looking back on this it's kind of interesting to reflect on what we did last year. And brings a smile to my face that much of it is pretty much the same again!

And so life goes on.

And so I'll try to put a few things down.

Fantastic summer.

A week in Ambleside. I was very pleased to manage some reasonable walks that gave me some good views over Windermere. Enjoyed a lovely day with John + Rose when we went to Bowness on the trail of Captain Flint's houseboat! Good weather and you all enjoyed swimming in the Lake.

Travelled to Bath to stay with Phil + Marcia. Enjoyed croquet, some good meals and a trip out to the ancient Roman Baths. Picked up a stomach bug, but didn't let it get in the way of enjoying ourselves too much.

Back to York and then off to Hawkshead with the larger family. Numerous problems with the house, but otherwise very nice. Visited a country show, did some walks, went on the Gondola on Coniston. Super week + nice to all be together.

Last week and Toby off on his Kayaking part II, John on an afternoon theatre course. Produced 'Jabberwocky' - really excellent!
