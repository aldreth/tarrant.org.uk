Cindy went over to the Cancer Care Centre for a 9:45 appointment this
morning for her third round of chemo and an appointment with Dr
Bottomley.

Again the chemo wasn\'t too bad, a couple of hours on a drip and not too
uncomfortable. On her way home she \"popped into town\" to do some
Christmas shopping - where does she get the energy?

She seems fine this evening, we\'re expecting that she will have a few
more days of feeling exhaused and that more hair will fall out.

She is due to have another scan on Thursday, and we should get the
results of that next week.
