I got back from town with the children just a couple of hours ago. We\'d
been into town to watch the lights being turned on, but the big
attraction were [Huge][1]. They played for about 45 minutes before the
lights were turned on - which was very dull, with the Lord Mayor,
Sherriff, someone from Nestle and a couple of boring Radio York
presenters - and then for about the same time afterwards. All their
usual songs - Jungle Book, Walking on Sunshine, American Pie, Build Me
Up Buttercup, Sit Down - and almost all with audience participation. I
really enjoyed it and so did the children. It was exciting being out in
town in the dark.

The photos are more impressionistic than realistic. It was dark and too
far away for the flash so most of them are a bit blurred, and possibly
look all the better for that.

The rest of the day - I went to yoga and the supermarket, the children
to school and Cindy rested. She\'s ok, but has some aches and pains and
feels drained.
