Cindy and I went to the hospital to get the results of a recent CT scan,
and they were very positive.

The treatment seems to have been very effective, with all of the tumours
shrinking or going entirely. There are still some left however - we knew
from the start that the chemo would not cure her, but this scan result
gives us hope for a pleasant and healthy summer, autumn and winter. Dr
Bottomley said he was very surprised how well it had gone, especially
considering how ill Cindy had been during the second treatment.

Tomorrow, Cindy goes in for the final treatment of this round, and then
in three weeks time she can have her Hickman line out - which will be a
great relief.
