Biked to the railway station this morning to catch the train to
Connisborough just one stop down the line from Doncaster. We had to
amuse ourselves for ha;f an hour waiting for the connection. Toby and
Rose found the luggage trolly a good way to pass the time and then Toby
decided that we should break into the packed lunch. The Earth Centre was
relatively quiet for a bank holiday and we set off with our map to make
the most of the full Â£10 package. Simulator first followed by the
climbing wall . Toby, John and Rose made good work of this and then
after a change of harness ascended the tower to leap offf on the zip
wire. It looked massively tall and John assured me it looked a very long
way down when you\'re standing on the platform. Pirates adventure
playground followed by the laser storm at which point Edward and I
decided to abandon them and discover the cafe for a drink. Onto mini
golf, Toby won, and archery which was at the furthest end of the centre
and very chilly so I set offf for the sub tropical clime of the sewage
processing greenhouse. More climbing wall, zip wire and laser storm and
then onto Amazon adventure finishing off with the simulator. Another
half hour wait at Doncaster causing a few moans that you didn\'t have to
wait if you came by car. Everybody very tired, but managed to cycle
home. All the children are really good at cycling now and Rose is
getting more road confident. We all had a great day and Toby even had a
bit of energy left to play an hours\' tennis with Luke Holman.
