#### Sit in nice gardens

The Alhambra garden was still looking good and the waterfalls delightful.

John + Rose thoroughly enjoyed themselves here early in the summer when we came so that I could have a Reiki treatment.\
You both got very wet, particularly you John - as usual.

It was a very hot day and to run in and out of the arched fountains must have been delicious.

Edward and I sat and watched you and we all eat a packed lunch before setting off home again.

I love the Alhambra garden. First the treat of walking through the Monet garden and then the complete change in atmosphere with the red tiles and long strip of water with regularly placed fountains.\
John and Rose like to change their direction by adjusting the water nozzle.

Today it was empty except for two women with a small child.\
I did not have very much time before my appointment and had to rush my salami sandwiches.

A very peaceful Reiki that has left me with a calm feeling - not that I confess to feelings of anxiety before I went.

Homeward now. Toby finishes school early and Edward can retrieve his role in picking up John + Rose.\
Swea has been - brought me chocolate! - so it well be lovely and clean.
