Sorry about the rubbish title, couldn\'t think of anything more
inspiring as just posting about general life at the moment! Been about 4
months since I last posted -  had a busy summer away in Greece, the
lakes and now started college. Posted ages ago that I finished my GCSEs
and got my results at the end of August, did very well and have my
awards ceremony next week.

Rose has settled very well into Millthorpe  enjoying it and did
eventually run her race for life - raising a lot of money. John is in
the school production of the Wizard of Oz and has been very busy in the
evenings with lots of rehearsals.  College is good very different from
Millthorpe and I am enjoying it a lot more.

Everyone is out at the moment at Granny\'s (Mary\'s)  ceremony as she is
becoming a Lay Reader. Going out for a meal at Meltons tonight which
will be very nice. Off out into town so I might post sometime soon or it
might be in a few more months!
