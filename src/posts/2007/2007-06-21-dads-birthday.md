Dad\'s birthday yesterday. Got a nice selection of presents. A hand made
pillow cover from Rose (made by Rose), a hand cooked meal from John, and
I got him a bag for his bike! I think I get most marks for effort! G
&#038; G gave him some money because he keeps on thinking on getting a
new bike and can\'t decide if it\'s worth it. Went out for a lovely meal
at La Piazza. Good as Usual.

Today I\'ve spent the day in Leeds with friends and bought some new
clothes for the hols. Looking forward to Greece very much. Everyone\'s
out at the moment seeing John\'s play that he has done with his theatre
group. Got a busy week ahead, and I\'m going away with friends next week
to Great Yarmouth! Should be great. Anyway I\'m off out now, so bye.
