Had a good couple of days recently, although the weather hasn\'t been
very good. Spent Friday in town with friends - dashing into random shops
when the heavens opened. It was my friends party last night and he was
quite worried because it was going to be outside and it had been
raining. Got luck though and the rain stopped at about 6 and then
didn\'t start up again till this morning, so it was a good party.

Haven\'t really done much this morning. Spent the morning recovering at
my friends house then played badminton this afternoon. Had some tasty
lamb chops for tea and I\'ve just got in from my run around the river.
(Second one in 3 days - that\'s dedication for me!) Dad\'s downstairs
having his birthday meal with Helen, Josh and Sharon. John cooked the
meal and it looks delicious. I\'ll be off now and I\'ll try and write
again before I go away on Monday.
