Believe it or not dad is now 39 which considering I\'m 16 still makes
him pretty young, but still he\'s almost 40! We\'re off out for a meal
tomorrow night at La Piazza one of the best Italian\'s in York -
defiantly our favourite. I cooked today for the first time in about a
year. I made mussels in a white wine sauce, with hand cut chips. It was
delicious. Not at school, but still being incredibly busy - didn\'t
manage to get everything done today; probably because most of days start
at about half eleven! Anyway I\'ll be off because I have to get up
tomorrow to give dad his present before J & R leave for school - so up
at half 7!!!!
