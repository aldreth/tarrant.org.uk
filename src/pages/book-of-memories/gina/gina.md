Dear Edward

I thought I would drop you a line to let you know I took part in the Race for Life last month. It was the third year I have run and this time I did it for Cindy.

It is a very emotional thing to do for everyone taking part but it is fun as well and there is a good opportunity to think about the people you are running for.

Imogen also ran hand we have raised about sixty pounds between us.

I hope you are all well and are continuing to have some good days. Will you manage to get away at all this summer? We are going camping in France at the end of August but are being posh and going in a caravan this year - luxury! Imogen is very pleased as it means she can take her hair straighteners. One needs to get one's priorities right when one is 12. I'm just hoping for no rain.

Anyway, I hope you don't mind me writing Edward. I know we only used to meet at Debbie's a couple of times a year but you are often in my thoughts.

With love\
Gina
