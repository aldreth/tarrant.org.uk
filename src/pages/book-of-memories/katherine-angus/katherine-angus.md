Dear Edward,

I was saddened to hear of Cindy's death.

My best memories of are of you both on the yearly visits to Barmoor as your family grew.

Cindy welcomed Joseph and I when we moved to York and supported me when choosing a secondary school. She was always kind and fun to be with.

My thoughts and love are with you.\
Katherine
