Cindy and I had lunch with Kath Pringle today. We\'ve seen very little
of her since she, Marcus and Louis left York 3 years ago. But since
Marcus\'s death earlier this year she and Louis have come back and are
currently living over in a friend\'s flat in Heslington. Louis has gone
back to the Steiner school for the one remaining year that he can go
there, and Kath has got a job in a special school in Knaresborough.

It was great to see her, and lunch turned into 3:30 by the time she
left. She looks just the same as when she left York. Louis who we saw
briefly a few weeks ago doesn\'t, of course. He has grown a lot and at
the moment looks ages older than Toby, even though they are about the
same age. We\'ve arranged that she and Louis will come over on New
Year\'s Eve, unless they arrange to go to Spain to see Marcus\'s sister.
