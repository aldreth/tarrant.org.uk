After saying bye to James and Emma (we left them at ours to have some
tea, bathe children and go home) we went to La Piazza and had pizzas
with Lance and Mary.

The next part of our action packed day was to go to see a concert at the
[National Centre for Early Music][1]. There was a [Christmas concert][2]
by the [York Waits][3]. I really enjoyed it, the children were a little
tired and got a bit bored, but we lasted the whole concert. They had
some huge recorders, the largest was about 6 or 7 feet tall, not
including the spike it rested on. It had a long curved metal tube as its
mouthpiece so you didn\'t have to stand on a chair to blow it. It made a
lovely gentle deep sound. They played lots of carols I knew and some I
didn\'t and it was a lovely evening.

And so to bed.
