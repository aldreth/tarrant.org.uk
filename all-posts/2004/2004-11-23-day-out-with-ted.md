I had a great day today. Immediately after dropping the children at
school, I went to the station, met Ted and went over to Leeds for the
day.

We spent the morning looking around the morning looking around the [art
gallery][1]. Unfortunately, the main part of the sculpture gallery was
closed while they were setting up a new exhibition. We looked at the
pictures though - some Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Francis Bacon and
Bridget Riley stick in my mind. There was also a 6ft tall model for a
150ft tall brick man by Antony Gormley that never got built and a rather
dubious video art installation.

Then we went for lunch at an Italian restaurant that was recommended by
one of Chris\'s friends and ate and drank well!

Then back to York in time to pick up the kids - or rather go to a
talk/show by Kjartan Poskitt plugging his new book - [The Magic of
Pants][2]. Kjartan did his usual amusing mix of maths tricks, magic and
banter.

Toby cooked tea, John and Rose went to gym and are finally in bed (just)
and I\'m hoping to watch Teachers with Cindy soon.

Quite a contast to Cindy\'s day.
