I went to the doctor again today, and he signed me off for another 8
weeks. This will take me up to the February half term holiday. Cindy\'s
current round of treatment will have finished by then. So I plan to go
back to work after that holiday - that\'ll give me a term and a half
till the end of the academic year.

School are arranging for the LEA occupational health people to get in
touch with me. It\'ll be interesting to see if they have any useful
suggestions.
