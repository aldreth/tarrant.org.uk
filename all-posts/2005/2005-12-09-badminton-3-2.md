I carry on trying to play badminton regularly. I\'ve had to miss a few
games over the last month or so, as people have been off school so
often, but I\'ve played twice this week to try and make up for it.

I still play [Simon][1] most regularly, and he still generally beats me
- in fact it was a whitewash this week - oh well I beat him last week
for a change. Today I played against Mark, who hasn\'t played much for
ages, so I won fairly easily. However, I think once he loses his
rustiness it\'ll be a different matter as he\'s got an amazing smash -
which just frightens me - when it goes over the net ;-).

John\'s been at home today, just exhausted I think because of the school
play and so on this week. Rose has been to school every day this week -
the first time for ages. Toby, of course, is doing his paper round,
school, youth club, squash... as usual.
