Nothing particular during the day - a bit of tidying up, putting away
the washing... Toby went off to Monk\'s Cross with Tom and Josh, but
didn\'t buy anything.

John and Rose went over to Tom and Anna\'s for a short time in the
afternoon and I pushed Cindy into town and we had coffee in The Pantry -
opposite Clifford\'s Tower.

In the evening we went and had supper at Lance and Mary\'s. Their Danish
friends Ole and Lillian are visiting.
