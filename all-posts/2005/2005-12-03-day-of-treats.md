On Friday, I had an excellent day. It started off with Rose going to
school, definitely a good start, making four out of five days last week.

I went out with Ted and Dave, first to [Bob Jackson Cycles][1] in Leeds.
Ted has been given an old frame that he wants cleaning up and
respraying. They had a fantastic range of colours to choose from - he
chose an unusual pepperminty blue colour - a rather more restful colour
that peppermint toothpaste though. The bike shop had some lovely bikes
in it, and managed to make Cycle Heaven look rather expensive (it\'s not
as convenient of course).

We went on to have a bit of a browse around the art/book/kitchen shops
in [Salts Mill][2]. Also of course, to have some lunch. Lovely wild
mushroom rissotto for me, tasty looking sausages for Dave and a pizza
for Ted.

Got home in time to pick up Rose - John to Nathan\'s. Rose had Sarah to
tea (pizza) and then Toby went out to youth club.

Most unexpectedly Kath rang to say she suddenly had a free theatre
ticket that evening, and would I like to go. Managed to get Beth to
babysit at the last minute and went out to see [Horror for Wimps][3].
