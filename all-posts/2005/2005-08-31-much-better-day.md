After a really bad couple of days, today was much better.

Cindy managed to get up after lunch, then I pushed her in her wheelchair
into town. We went to Capaldi\'s for coffe, where - lo and behold - we
bumped into the children who had gone out with Lance and Mary.

Cindy stayed up for tea and is now watching Daziel and Pascoe. Lovely to
have her downstairs!
