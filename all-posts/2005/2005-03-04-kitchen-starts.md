Dave came up on Sunday evening and by Monday evening we had no units in
the kitchen - and no kitchen ceiling. The old kitchen ceiling was so
wrecked, so much lighting needed to be done, and a tube for an extractor
fan needed to be put in so we\'d decided total removal would be the best
option.

We now have a fridge, freezer, kitchen table, toaster, kettle and so on
in the back room and not much space to move around. Cindy had been very
organised and cooked lots of food in advance, so we\'ve eaten well so
far. As we don\'t have a cooker at the moment, most of our evening meals
have been cooked at my parent\'s house.

The plasterboarding for the new ceiling was done in two evenings
(because it\'s a two person job and I was at school) and was finished
last night (Wednesday). Dave has almost finished the wiring for the
sockets and lights and is sorting out our rotten door frame.

Next week the damp company arrive to dig up the entire floor, damp-proof
it and lay a new one - and also replaster/skim the walls and ceiling.
That\'ll make even more mess and dust no doubt. Fortunately we are able
to move into my parents house for a bit.

Once the floor and walls have dried, Dave will come back and fit our new
kitchen, which should be done by Easter.
