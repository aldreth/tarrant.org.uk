After Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday morning off school, Rose went
back on Tuesday morning, and had a good time.

She had been exhausted, full of a cold and finding school very
difficult. It seemed too busy, with no time for her to be quiet. Rose
also finds it difficult to talk about anything like that, so it took a
lot of time to be able to talk calmly about when she would feel ready to
go to school. However, we managed to on Monday, so on Tuesday I wasn\'t
panicking about getting her up and was able to let her sleep in, so she
got about an hour and a half extra sleep. By the afternoon she was quite
positive about going back, and she seemed to have a good time.

After school she went to Gemma\'s and then straight on to gym.
