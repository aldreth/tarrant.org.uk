Of course, I can\'t count. Yesterday\'s [post][1] looked back ten years
to the night before John was born. Of course it was eleven years. So
Toby was doing his christmas concert at Knavesmire Nursery, not
Scarcroft. The rest was right.

We opened presents this morning after Toby got back from his
paper-round. John seemed pleased. He was excited and woke at five this
morning, but was considerate enough not to wake anyone else then.

Scarcroft is being inspected by Ofsted yesterday and today. John is
leading school council today, and showed one of the inspectors the
school allotment yesterday. So the inspectors will probably wonder if
any other children do anything!
