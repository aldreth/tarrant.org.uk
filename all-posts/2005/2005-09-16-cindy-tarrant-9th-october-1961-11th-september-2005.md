      My best memories of Cindy are when she was pregnant with Toby when you
      came back to London - she was so excited and we used to get the baby book
      out every week to see how big he would be etc!!


      Cindy was a one off and a very good friend to many people. I have rarely
      met such a positive lovely person.


      I also remember your wedding with great fondness and the barn dance
      afterwards - great fun. Will try to find some Old Sarah Bonnell School
      photos to send.

      Our memories of Cindy mostly involve laughing - whether lifting the mood
      of the everyday mundane tasks, or enjoying a glass of wine after a meal,
      we can still hear her laugh.


      To say that Cindy was generous, engaging, funny and simply fantastic
      company is to state the obvious. 


      For us, Cindy always embodied what it is to be part of a loving family.

      Just read Chris' memory about Cindy being pregnant with Toby ... I
      remember Joyce discussing with me what colour outfit to knit for the new
      arrival. She decided on pale green! We both had visions of Cindy with the
      new baby on the back of her bike!


      My best memories however are of one mad summer when we decided to go
      running before school. I lived in Stratford and Cindy in East Ham. We met
      up in Plashet Park then ran back to Cindy's for a breakfast of stewed
      apple and natural yogurt (very healthy). 


      O and one more wonderful moment, when I went to Heathrow to see Cindy and
      Karen off on their round the world trip ... they flew aeroflot.


      I miss her loads.


      Chris, please get in touch if you read this!



      Love Jane
