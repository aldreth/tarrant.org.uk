John and Rose have gone to bed. Cindy is having a nap because she\'s
exhausted.

Toby is on a coach on his way home from Manchester Airport, where he\'s
gone with school to meet his German exchange, Tobias. They should be
arriving in York in the next half an hour or so. They\'ll probably both
be hungry!

Tobias is staying until next Tuesday, and he\'s got an action packed
schedule lined up. They\'re both going into school tomorrow, then off to
Bradford to the National Museum of Film and Photography. Saturday, Toby,
Tobias and I are off, with Keith, to watch Huddersfield Town play, then
in the evening one of Toby\'s friends and German visitor is coming to
watch videos and eat pasta. Sunday we\'re going to Whitby for fish and
chips. Monday is school for Toby and a day out in York for Tobias, then
bowling organised by the school in the evening. On Tuesday, Toby and
Tobias go to school and Tobias goes home from there.

I\'m off to pick up them up in ten minutes or so - oh,there\'s the
phone!!
