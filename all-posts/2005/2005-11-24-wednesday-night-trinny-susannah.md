We seem to have got into a routine of all watching What Not to Wear
every Wednesday evening, even though it goes on too late for a school
night!

We all love laughing at the terrible \"before\" parts, and marvelling at
the transformation at the end of each show. I realise that I don\'t have
a leg to stand on in the fashion stakes, but it\'s still funny. As these
reality tv makeover shows go it isn\'t too bad, and sometimes the
changes in people\'s self-confidence, like last night, is astonishing.
