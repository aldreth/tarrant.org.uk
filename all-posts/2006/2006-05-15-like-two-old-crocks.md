Played badminton with Simon at lunch time today. He\'d cycled into a
lamppost and had a very sore and stiff shoulder and, for some reason,
I\'d woken up with a stiff and aching back. So we shuffled about the
court and neither of us played very well. Still fun though.

Toby was trying to coach me this morning - \"What could you do to get
better?\" I don\'t want to have to think about it, I just like playing
(but if it meant I won more often...)
