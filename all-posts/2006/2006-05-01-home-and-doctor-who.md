It was raining this morning, after lovely weather for the rest of the
weekend, so we left by about 9:30 after packing and tidying. Before
leaving the village we went to see Arthur Ransome\'s grave, which was in
the village churchyard.

Toby had lots of course work to do, which was another reason for leaving
early. I cooked a big pasta sauce, because we\'d invited all the Holmans
and all the Cadbury Parkers around to have tea and watch [Doctor
Who][1]. Much enjoyed by all (except Cathy - who thinks it\'s all
nonsense!)
