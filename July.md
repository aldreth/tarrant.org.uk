E + I take off first thing and have coffee at the Art Gallery - E does a quick reccy for a Link Group visit. He dashes off for squash and I go and do a bit of shopping. Got hame + put lunch together for Simon Palmour + E. Lovely sunny day. Bob over to the PO + Alligator to get some tofu for R. Fri. slob en famile in front of TV and then watch a DVD with T.

Feeling not very good this morning. Contemplate getting T to take R to dance, but manage to get myself out. Take it slow. Cook T and I some breakfast + then return to pick up R. Then time to take off to Elvington for John's dance. He and his group were very good. Off to Jo + Bill's for BBQ. Have a really nice evening sitting and chatting in the garden. Children watch Live Aid concert - finish watching it at home. All go to bed very late.

Decided to stay home + cook Sunday lunch. Such an effort on the breathing front and pain in my chest. Feel very low, slow and cheesed off. Nice lunch with L + M. Luke also joins us. Cathy phones + invites Toby sailing - he's very happy to go. R goes off to the park for an hour with Caralan, watch in pocket + strict return time. E for a walk, L + M to the park to listen to the band. Return for a cup of tea. Cycle R + Caralan to her house. Caralan has a lot more 'freedom' and I'm trying to work out the best way of letting R have her friendship while maintaining my peace of mind. T returns exhausted, but having had a great time. Feels + is sick later in the evening. Watch men's final - Federer wins, of course! Snip + trim in the yard, cul snails. Feel shockingly miserable in bed - breathing just seems so rock bottom - doom + gloom mood... poor E!

T poorly this morning - didn't even do his paper round. Generally very exhausted from all his activities over the last week. Me very slow getting up Feeling not too good. Once up felt much better. Cool + raining. Cycled in and met Cathy at Betty's. Helen Cadbury came too. Nice tea, scone + chat. Dug out some fabrics for Jo and did a few embellishment samples before going to Deborah's textile club. The hour went really quickly and we were both busy solidly as the girls' confidence grow + they've speeded up. Lauren + Nathan for tea - surprise arrival of Caralan. Popped over to Jo with fabrics, lots of coughing + clearing my chest - think I've been ill

Met up with Alison Forrester for coffee at the Blakeshead. Sat in the garden until a huge downpour chased us inside. Alison ready to slide into lunch - no fear! Make away when the weather breaks. Pick up some groceries on the way home + make lunch. E out walking with Ted. Finish off embroidering Jane's silk wedding dress squares and generally rest. Jenny does the whole gym run, so just have to sort John out. He's had a bit of a tummy ache, but seems ok now. Feeling very drained again. Horrible cough. Breathless. Reading good book, Kensuke's Kingdom.

With great difficulty, tidy J's room in readiness for Swea. E + I decide to do some culture vulturing @ the galleries and have lunch out. Only make one exhibition in St Mary's. Strange suspended ceiling of fibre fill, couldn't help wondering if Boyes stock it in this width! Made me want to leap into the middle of it. Very good lunch at the tasting room - [see blog](/2005/07/06/the-tasting-room) - over which we lingered until pick up time for the children. Yoga time and I know I've had it so watch new drama with E.

Visit Jules + Marcus and lovely new baby Freddie. Perfect little boy with golden hair. Jules looking as lovely as every - even managed to paint her toes! Terrible news of several bomb attacks in London: one on a bus and several in prime underground stations. Co-inciding with the G8. We receive texts + emails from Jane, Katharine + Helen.

Very hot today. E play badminton. Pop into town in the morning and deliver Mimi's trousers. Browse in a few charity shops before doing market and home. Lazy afternoon in the heat. Much lolling around in the evening. I think everybody is exhausted. T goes off to youth club.
#####################

Very hot again. J + R enjoy Bill + Jo's new paddling pool for a couple of hours after dance. Really hot again. Bake some tartlet cases + fill with creme patissiere + nectarines and take to Judy + Keith's BBQ. Meet up with Alison + David who we met at Christmas + their 2 children Kirsty + Brody. Really nice evening and good supper. Judy's garden looking lovely. Newly installed - by Keith - waterfall into the pond. Very impressive.

Had a devastating beetroot + celery juice this morning - had the effect of a mega scouring pad. E consequently had to cook Sunday lunch whilst I rested up on the sofa! Pauline looking very tanned from her Turkish holiday. Enjoyed nice roast lamb + strawbs + meringues. Chilled cava. Everybody to the park whilst I rested up on the sofa. R had a miserable moment, but thankfully recovered. Extremely hot again. Back yard looked like it was gasping. Watered Mary's garden - takes ages there's so much in it.
#####################
11
Enjoyed a very nice Reiki - Robert has expanded more in minerals - gave me a couple of stones. Retrieved my knitting before joining Deborah for textiles. Only one week left. J to Nathan's for tea. R to buy trainers with E. T had first day of activities week with a walk in the Hole of Horcum. Manic search for my rail card - still can't find it.
#####################
12
The ticket collector didn't even look at the tickets - relaxed into the journey. David met us at Kings X. Very hectic outside. Camera crews and news reporters around the collection of flowers. The buses were busy with much of the tube being out of action. Went past the street blocked where the no 30 bus blew up. All very strange. Met Helen at the portrait gallery and had lunch in the basement before searching out the Frida Kahlo. Returned to H + D for cool refreshment before setting off for Jane Byrne's about 1/2 walk away. She has a small house on a terrace and has just decorated bits of it. Back to D + H and chatted to Sam for a bit.

Woke feeling very breathy and with a pain in my chest. I was extremely slow. Nice breakfast in the garden and then we eventually set off for Eltham Palace - Art Deco feast established by the Courtaulds. The gardens - that we hadn't seen last time - were lovely. Very, very hot. By the end of the afternoon I realised that I had an infection. Had felt very spaced out at times and was glad of the wheelchair. Managed to see a doctor and get some antibiotics. Lovely pasta supper.
#####################
14
Decided against the V+A and arranged to meet Jane + Andy for lunch. London Bridge was teeming and we arrived just in time for the 2 min silent memorial for last weeks bomb's.

Sushi lunch - very interesting and very nice. I had just about used up my energy by then and we bid farewell and taxied over to Kings X and caught a much earlier train. Nice journey back. Home just as children and L + M were eating tea. A lovely trip.

Saw Dr S this morning to discuss the nature of my demise - so this was a jolly little meeting. Feel happier now and realise that so long as everybody talks and plans there really is no need to lie and gasp and suffer. Having know Dr S for so long will, I think, make everything much easier for me and everybody.

Onto sports day - how I missed a good running race. Can't see that the children raise their heart beat one iota. E played badminton. Me gentle afternoon - still recovering.
#####################
16
Dance as per usual and then R invited to Freddie's to play. E + J off to the Palmours for a Tour de France party. T off into town so I had a quiet afternoon. Went to Katie's daugher's wedding reception in the evening with R + J (T with head in new Harry Potter), J took Harry Potter with him. chatted to the Palmours. Didn't stay long as T on his won. Watched a bit of Jeeves and Wooster.

Stunningly hot day. Me a very slow morning, but with mention of the seaside managed to get myself up. It was well worth it, couldn't bear the thought of lying in bed all day and missing out on Hunmanby. Tide was 1/2 hour short of high when we got there. Feasted on chips for lunch before descending to the beach. Every body swam, <ins>very</ins> hot. Lovely, lovely day. Could have stayed longer, but children hungry. Lovely fish supper. T a cinema date with Katie - think it's his first or at least the first we've known about. Lucky him - very exciting. Have lived to see it - another milestone met.

Feeling so much better this morning - woke with some energy which makes me realise that I have actually been rather ill. A slowish day and then to the final textile club with Debora. Receive surprise thank you card, choccies and voucher for Pextons to share with Deborah. Have really enjoyed supporting her with this club. D is very inspiring, very organised and really nice to work with.
#####################

School concert at Scarcroft this evening. E takes me up the back stairs to avoid the crowds as I need the oxygen. Very packed. Lots of solos. Anna and Tom very good on trumpet and trombone respectively. R sings in the choir and takes part in the street dance. J in with his class singing. We only have another 2 summer concerts to attend after tonight! Tidy the yard. It's staring to look a little heat exhausted. E attacks the bush at the front.

T receives an award for academic achievement this afternoon. Also for punctuality and attendance. Very, very happy for him. He's worked hard and has really made the best of things - French possibly excepting! His report is excellent, one of the very best. Brings home his art folder, which is surprisingly very good. I hadn't realised he was so good at this - he always plays it down.

Today I went to Whitby with Sam. A lovely breezy day. Arrived ready for our first snack at the Shepherds Purse. From there Sam pushed me round to the harbour and out onto the pier. Without the protection of the harbour the sea was rough and exciting. The children would have loved to get out in it with the body board. Returned to the Shepherds Purse for coffee and then made our way back to the car. A really lovely day chatting with Sam. We always have a nice time. M for tea.
#####################
22
Pop down to the allotment first thing. T is helping M move some manure. I manage to pull a few onions. Given another go at things I would definitely like to have an allotment. There is a wonderful view of the Minster from the top plots. Also a good one from Millthorpe school I noticed on Tuesday. Spend the afternoon cooking for the holiday. Bob out with E and have a spending spree at Caroline’s.
#####################
23
L + M came for breakfast. L very stressed and didn't stay long. Has lots of work to do before going to Birmingham this afternoon. We all pack and leave. M stays as they have Norwegians in their house this week. Only one serious traffic jam on the way to Keswick. Children suddenly remembered the house on seeing it. All sort out rooms. We discover that we should have brought sheets. E buys a bulk lot from Oxfam - £22 not bad for sheets for 5. After a reviving cup of tea we head off for the lake. The water level is noticeably lower. R loses her new waterproof shoe in the mud, J fails to find it! Nice meatball tea. T + E chess. R + me mastermind.
#####################
24
Start the day with a lovely boat trip around Derwentwater. Sun's out and the view of the surrounding hills is absolutely gorgeous. E + the boys get off at High Brandelhow and walk via a scramble to Catbell. R + I continue back to Keswick and then sit on the beach enjoying the sun. T buys a dingy and all enjoy it after tea - great fun. Tea at Brysons - much looked forward to on memory of our last visit here.
#####################
25
Very late morning. Finally manage to get out and walked along the lake where the wheelchair could be pushed. Quite a short walk, but nice to feel out and about. Had a sandwich sitting by the Lake and then did a bit of browsing in town. Sat in the garden in the afternoon. Very nice Cumberland sausage for tea. Stone Circle in the afternoon - make vague plans to return and watch the sun rise!
#####################
26
E + the boys leave at 7:30 for their date with Go Ape. R + I follow a couple of hours later. They all have a fantastic time, it certainly lived up to J's expectations. Brunch in the cafe and then all go cycling. I revisit Blackwell House travelling across Windermere by the ferry. T arrives home sporting quite bad grazing from a fall. All very tired.
#####################
27
T not up for a scramble this morning, he's feeling a bit sore and stiff. E takes J + R off for a short scramble + T + I go and look at video footage of the Osprey at the Whitaker Visitor Center. Duck feeding + failed mini golf expedition (v. long queue) in the afternoon. Nice evening out followed by game of Twits.
#####################
28
Woke to steady rainfall this morning. J keen to see cars for the stars so sets off with E + R while T + I go to the supermarket for this evening's supper. Amuse ourselves very much from the house, playing card games, reading, watching TV. Breathing getting very poor. Cannot walk any distance certainly up hill. Have periodic episodes where I feel particularly laboured. V sad.
#####################
29
Although overcast it is not raining and the little rainfall we have is while we're in the car driving to Cockermouth. Visit Wordsworth’s birthplace. A wonderfully restored 17th century family house with cottage garden. Plenty of eager staff on hand, some in costume explaining the ways of the day. E + T leave us on the way home to walk to Skidaw. J + R + I play several games of the Twits. Off to the cinema this evening.
#####################

Cinema didn't happen. Played some cards with R. E and the boys watched a TV movie. Managed to get up reasonably well and help with packing everything up. Went well and the children were very good packing the boots. Home in time for lunch. General unpacking + washing this afternoon and then went to Matthew + claire's party at 6pm. Really nice social occasion and lovely food. Left quite early because the children had had enough - fair does.
#####################

I had a very slow Sunday morning, despite thinking I might have gone to Meeting. More washing! Went to Chrissie + Jonathan's for a BBQ - met up with her nephew James + his wife Gillian, small daughter Gemma. J + R loved playing in the garden and discovering the frogs in the poind. T opted out and went to the cinema with Luke. As James + co left Margaret + David arrived - people from Sheffield we have met before. Had a really nice afternoon. Beautiful sunny evening despite rest of day being dull.
