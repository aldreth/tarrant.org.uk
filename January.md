Dentist at 9am - my teeth are aching, so feeling anxious about Simon prodding around. Off to Euraka with Jo + children on the train. Had a filling, not too bad. Finished the day with FnC enjoyed by all. It has been a very good way to end the holidays.

E & I enjoyed a morning in town doing a spot of shopping and then went and had lunch together. It's been ages since we've had time alone. Bought some lovely wool to start my next project - have to stich up the black slash neck before I can start this lot. Enjoyed Danielle Palmour's drinks party for her 40th.

Had a hearing testing today - all ok barring a slight niggle that they will keep an 'eye' (ear!) on. Started the morning with an hour steaming and sitting in the jacuzzi at the Living Well centre - thank you Judy. L + M picked us up at 5pm for the W Yorks playhouse to see 'Lion, Witch + the Wardrobe'. Lovely tea and super production with great set + costumes. Everybody really enjoyed it.

Very windy morning, felt quite worried about Toby out on his paper-round this morning. Managed to walk Rose to dance, E. picked her up. Jean came bearing cream cake and allotment goodies. Always good to see her. Have arrange to go to the cinema on Thurs. Gentle afternooon saving energy for Debbie's party. Nice, but strange with no John & about 2 other women going through a divorce. What is going on?

E took all to Meeting and I had a very slow morning feeling tired and with back ache - no where near as aba as last time, however. John to gym and Toby to f/ball this afternoon. Rose backed some very nice coconut biscuits.

Rose upset this evening - wasn't sure why. I think because I was raggy.
