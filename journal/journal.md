#### Sit in nice gardens

The Alhambra garden was still looking good and the waterfalls delightful.

John + Rose thoroughly enjoyed themselves here early in the summer when we came so that I could have a Reiki treatment.\
You both got very wet, particularly you John - as usual.

It was a very hot day and to run in and out of the arched fountains must have been delicious.

Edward and I sat and watched you and we all eat a packed lunch before setting off home again.

I love the Alhambra garden. First the treat of walking through the Monet garden and then the complete change in atmosphere with the red tiles and long strip of water with regularly placed fountains.\
John and Rose like to change their direction by adjusting the water nozzle.

Today it was empty except for two women with a small child.\
I did not have very much time before my appointment and had to rush my salami sandwiches.

A very peaceful Reiki that has left me with a calm feeling - not that I confess to feelings of anxiety before I went.

Homeward now. Toby finishes school early and Edward can retrieve his role in picking up John + Rose.\
Swea has been - brought me chocolate! - so it well be lovely and clean.

#### Take time out with Jane + Mary - Steam

Said farewell to Dr Finan. She has seen the arrival of all of you and looked after us since we have lived in York E + I were sad to say goodbye.

A lovely busy week.

Edward has booked a flight, hotel + visit to James + Emma in Amsterdam over my birthday. Very exciting. We are now looking through the guidebook to plan what we want to see. Really looking forward to some time together - travelling again... lovely.

John, Rose + Toby will have the pleasure of granny + grandpa looking after you - always nice.

E has a job at Tregellasis(?) as a teaching assistant - it is quiet here today and very strange being on my own. I think I'm rattling around a bit.\
Will cycle along the river in a min. - one of my very favourite things to do - to buy a recorder for Rose, theatre tickets for Swan Lake ballet and provisions for the Arc Light puddings.

Had a sauna + steam in Harrogate yesterday with Jane + Mary. Travelled by train - much more relaxing than car - and spent a good two hours getting hot and sweaty and plunging into cool water. We were the only 3 in the place for the last hour. It was very calm + still.\
Betty's for carrot + orange soup afterwards.\
Just met you all leaving Grandpa's and we walked home together.

Saw 'Calendar Girls' with Chris Hughes on Saturday, couldn't get tickets for the 7:15 so bought for the 9:15 and both came back here. Chris made you all giggle - I've noticed this lately, she is always fun with you all and you love it. We set to and came up with a Penn Group activity, made a leaf shape brooch when she then wore to the City Screen.

E, you are low on this day and it makes me sad to know it is because of me. I love you.

Sunday lunch with L + M, Andy and Jane.

Then Jane takes you all for a swim. Toby + John have been big time bickering and I have to make sure you both understand to stay together in the changing rooms. Jane said you had a great time together!!\
And so it will be, I suspect, you will ultimately always look out for each other and most of the time will like each other.

Off I go now on my bike. Lovely sunny day. Lovely, lovely.

(I think the date's right)

#### Have dinner with old friends; Jane Moll + Jean Grant

#### Take Toby to the theatre "Single Spies"

#### Spend an evening with Edward

I have left my diary at home and am sitting in the gym club. John is attending the Friday invitation class and I have a pile of reading matter and this diary. Also am indulging in mini-smarties and coffee.

Have had a busy time since last writing. I am amazed how quickly the days go by and left wondering how I ever managed to fit everything in when I was working.

I like being at home looking after the school runs, tea and other domesticy things. The freedom to meet up with friends or go shopping is great. Getting up later is good for me and not having to work in the evening is wonderful.

Last weekend John had his first weekend away at Barmoor with Meeting. A mixed excitement for John. The Friday evening saw a fatal motorbike accident at Stockton-on-the-Forest and we sat for over an hour in traffic. Oscar gave us a running commentary about possible routes. Took the back route as darkness fell and rain lashed against the windscreen. Messed a turing and finally arrived at Barmoor 2 1/2 hours later - took me 50mins to get back.

Settled John + Oscar into the bedroom and you bounded off John to join the group. I wanted to give you a goodbye hug and kiss. You would have nothing of it - who can blame you - but you looked a bit anxious. I decided to leave quickly before one of us got upset.

You had a wonderful weekend. Another experience in independence and a great feeling for you to be in control of your own time.

Toby spent Friday evening + Saturday with a friend, Josh Cole. A really nice boy from school. You both had a good time: car boot, town, computer. We then went to the theatre. Pouring with rain so we drove.\
Quite a sophisticated play and not a lot of action. Burgess + Blunt were the focus. 2 short plays and it really would have helped had we read the background - one play where I should have bought a programme.\
You fell asleep in part 2 + snored!! Had to give you a nudge and work hard to stop myself giggling. Lovely to have time out together, you are such good company Toby.

Picked Rose up from Eleanor's on Sunday teatime. We cycled together across Scarcroft Green you Rose chatting happily about your afternoon with Eleanor. You are so happy and confident. I'm so glad!

Popped into Sam's for coffee on Tuesday morning - left 3 hours later. She is good to tak with and to just spend time with. However, she does have 2 jobs - no 3 - and I mustn't distract her from what she has to do.

Missed E at lunchtime

Had coffee with Chrissy Dell on Wednesday and lunch with Cathy Holman on Thursday - truly a "lady that does lunch".

Popped in to see Swea this morning. Nice to sit and talk with her rather than her doing my cleaning. Her mum died last week and she is sad but realistic and with a good sense of humour.

Came home to have lunch with Edward. The end of a rather boring week at Tregellis for you. You are taking Rose off to a puppet show this evening and then we can have some time together.

Have been having such a good time that I have not written anything here.

Edward and I had a wonderful time in Amsterdam for my birthday. Galleries, coffee shops, walks, canals and so on. Fantastic.

Great minimalist hotel room, but with everything we needed including a great shower!

Busy build up to Christmas.\
Had a day out in Beverley with Judy and bought an advent calendar at the Minster.

Good work/Christmas assemblies for John and Rose. Good to get to see them at last. John a 'tropical' dancer, Rose a 'mouse' with long, long snout.

Christmas week and my family came to Stamford Bridge. Meet up with Mandy + co for some last minute shopping.

We all go to carols at Meeting on Christmas Eve - everybody seemed to enjoy this.

Bucks fizz + smoked salmon on rye for Christmas breakfast with M + D, D + M, Amy + Tom. Lots of pressie unwrapping. All goes well. Then we go to L + M for Christmas lunch + more pressies. Jack + Grace are there with Will + Sarah. Jack is a delight an enormous baby and very sweet. Grace looking like a little dolly in a very designer outfit. Katharine getting larger and glowing with happiness, thank goodness. Simon over supportive. Jane + Andy.

And of course L + M putting on a super feast as always. So the dining table was very full and heavy with festive fare.

And so the holiday passes with lots of gatherings.

We go to a good new year's party John + Debbie's and drive home through heavy snowfall. Had a fun game of 'doodo', the children enjoyed themselves running all over the house and goodness knows wat they got up to.

So busy enjoying life have had no inclination to write anything here.

Keep say to E that I haven't written anything down.

Looking back on this it's kind of interesting to reflect on what we did last year. And brings a smile to my face that much of it is pretty much the same again!

And so life goes on.

And so I'll try to put a few things down.

Fantastic summer.

A week in Ambleside. I was very pleased to manage some reasonable walks that gave me some good views over Windermere. Enjoyed a lovely day with John + Rose when we went to Bowness on the trail of Captain Flint's houseboat! Good weather and you all enjoyed swimming in the Lake.

Travelled to Bath to stay with Phil + Marcia. Enjoyed croquet, some good meals and a trip out to the ancient Roman Baths. Picked up a stomach bug, but didn't let it get in the way of enjoying ourselves too much.

Back to York and then off to Hawkshead with the larger family. Numerous problems with the house, but otherwise very nice. Visited a country show, did some walks, went on the Gondola on Coniston. Super week + nice to all be together.

Last week and Toby off on his Kayaking part II, John on an afternoon theatre course. Produced 'Jabberwocky' - really excellent!

Have thought a lot about whether or not to write you all a letter each for when you are older. This is because I am feeling very much like the best breath is draining out of me as a serious wheeze seems to be setting in and my energy is failing. Now this may of course be yet another re-run of the treatment taking its course and I will be 'bouncing' around again tomorrow. Or at least sometime soon. But I'm afraid I cannot dispel this doom + gloom feeling every time my health goes in this direction.

So what would I want to say to you all that you do not already know.\
Can I possibly say what I feel in a letter.\
How much do you all remember.

#### Toby - so excited today because your new phone has arrived.

Very sophisticated and very expensive. Lots of hard work on your paper round and not so hard work on the few babysits you have started to do. You are a great boy and although becoming more independent and off with your friends you always seem happy to be at home with us and still like to go on holiday with us.

Have driven you over to Josh's to pick-up your stuff. I like to do things for you. I know I sometimes indulge you when E tells me to let you "do it for yourself" but I am ever conscious that I won't be able to do things for you for much longer and in fact you will have to do more for me.

Already you help with carrying heavy stuff for me, often unasked. You seem very sensitive to my limitations and do help me. Of the three of you, you will have the most memories, being the oldest. A double edged sword. Remembering more also means knowing more fully how ill I have been during your formative years. I hope this doesn't make you feel - I don't know 'disadvantaged', 'cheated'?? What I don't want is for you to blame future ills on me being ill and I hope I have managed to be 'quietly' ill most of the time so that it doesn't feel as though it was always at the forefront of our lives. I'm afraid it feels very much at the forefront this week.
I'm trying to get a grip. Certainly reading last year it seems I was feeling similar.

How can I not think every day that time is limited, especially when I wheeze just climbing the stairs.

Certainly if there is life after death I am going to be a runner and I will run every day because I can.
