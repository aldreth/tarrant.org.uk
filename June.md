Hunmanby Gap with M. Met Will + Sarah + the children there. All skim boards + body boards well used. Tide coming in - further up the beach than we thought. Eventually moved because of rain. V hard for me getting up the hill now - very sad! M + R off on a walk - R returns weeping thinking I might have left without her even though she knew I wouldn't - the thought just took her over! E + I to the theatre 'Players' - excellent really enjoyed it.

Feeling extremely grim on getting up. All seems too much of an effort so retire to bed and E takes J + R + T to Meeting. Doze on and off listening to the radio and eventually get up not before everybody gets back. Potter about and then take R to the Castle museum to look at the postcards exhibition. E + J to the city screen for Star Wars movie.

T with Luke had a McDs for lunch!

E busy DIYing in the kitchen ready for Dave. Did very large supermarket shop - felt quite exhausted, spending £130+ - leave E to bring in the heavy stuff. Girls arrive for sewing and decide it's much too nice to stay in so we head off for the park with the skate board. Suddenly feel much better trigger off by lovely view of the millennium bridge and seeing the girls laughing so much. Man goes over handlebars unexpectedly. Go to meditation group - lovely ride back at 10pm along the river.

Cycle into town to shop after breakfast and return home in time for lunch - smoked salmon and avocado rolls with a glass of frascati - v delicious. Spend a lot of time sitting tin the yard and make a fruit cake in readiness for Dave + meatballs for T's send off meal.

Really nice and I think we will try and meet again - managed to speak a bit of Italian. R off with M via Nok's 'jumble sale'. Just E + J for tea as I was feeling v full from the Italian. Very quiet without T. E saw him before he left. Nice yoga building up to moon prayer. T texted me at 11:30 - 'nice family'.

Lovely summer day. Mary drove me to Vertigrow and I spent yet more money on the garden. Fantastic trees for sale, very much for the BIG garden - and wallet - and an enormous selection of plants. Spent the afternoon replanting the raised bed; took out the wall flowers and replaced with some nice grasses and some bedding plants. Audrey gave me a scented geranium and M gave me lots of tomato plants & some sweet peas. Looking really lovely. Poor J sick on and off all day. He's v. bored. R had a sudden black mood lifted after tea. She's decided to be a vegetarian.

Carol + Claire came this morning for coffee bringing a large piece of fern from their garden. This will shield the bin nicely. Met up with Helen Cadbury for lunch at the Blakeshead - very nice pumpkin soup! Dashed into Borders to buy Chrissy a notebook and pen for her birthday. Dropped Rose with Anna at the youth club - their first visit - and then headed off to L + M for pre-dinner drinks. Very pleasant sitting on the terrace. Raced off to No 8 and met up with Chrissy + Jonathan, Roger + Jo - very good meal. L + M to J + R for an Indian meal.
#####################

Quite an effort getting up this morning - no T to buy us bacon! Dropped Rose at dance and headed back to have coffee with Jane. She checked missing guests on the patchwork squares of her dress. E babysitting for Jack + Grace and R having a sleep over with Lily. J + I watch Dr Who and then head over to spend time with E - the children were still up - Jack very miserable. Eventually fell asleep just before everybody got back! Lovely cake made by Sarah.
#####################
12
Very quiet in the house with just John. Start to make picnic + then cycle to Meeting with John. Doing Fox Group - we do something on treats + make cornflake crispy cakes. John had found the 'Chocolate Cake' poem for me on the internet - one of my favourites. Enjoy a lovely Meeting House picnic at the retreat with Martin Ward's usual treasure hunt enjoyed by all children, a rounders game, Chris H.'s tour of the retreat and Bone's history walk. Judith showed us how to make flower garlands.
#####################
13
Wet and very cold - E puts the heating back on. A particularly good Reiki with lots of focus on my chest area. Last bit spoilt rather because I was desperate for the loo. Ask Robert about R feeling panicky - he suggests homeopathy - aconite, go + buy some from Tullivers. Join Deborah for textiles and help thread needles + tie knots! John needs hat making material, dash back to town + buy vilene from Boyes. Hat make with J while E + R watch Dr who. R sad + sobbing again, pop a few more aconites + hope for relief for her.

Rose very anxious this morning. Decides she want me to go. Outcome - success. R manages examination + x ray. No treatment as yet - review in a year - thank goodness. Advises her to stop sucking her thumb. Go to Meltons Too for late breakfast + then R + I buy stuffed lion + cat bed for Daisy in charity shop. T home - hurray - have missed him. He's had a lovely time and was clearly not daunted by staying with Tobias's family.
#####################

Manage slightly early rise this morning. (Cat loves new cat bed.) Tidy round in time for Swea + do some Italian. L + M for lunch. Cold + drizzly for our trek to the races. Park bike far too early. Stark realisation of how limited my lung is. I feel v tight chested + it is a huge effort to get to the railings enclosure - fantasise about my dear electric bike! Great fun watching pack of race horses gallop by. We lose £8. M is the only one to back a 'placing'. J has had good time with Claire -cooking. T on computer and R out at a party. Great day.
#####################
16
Go into York to look for pressie inspiration + buy pedal for my bike - pretty much run out of steam, very quickly - have to rest at Capaldis - very convenient! Sainsburys after lunch + then definitely run out of energy. All the walking yesterday has exhausted me beyond my reckoning - lots of pathetic lounging around feeling weary for, not of, day. How have I managed to get in this state. In my head I'm running + busy. Really find it difficult to tolerate today.
#####################
17
Bit of a shop + sort day. Feeling quite breathy still, sort out T's DofE bits and pressies for Fathers Day + and Jack, L + E's birthdays. R off for a sleep over and visit to the pub - feel very uneasy about this one - E checks it out. T off with rucksack for DofE weekend. J, E & I go to Batman. Very nice to go out just with John. Enjoy drink in the bar before the film. Good movie. York as busy as we've ever seen it at 11pm with Ascot revellers.

All to Meeting this morning and Rose is invited to the beach with Mimi. Very hat and humid. J, E + I go to Tanya + Charles for croquet and frogs. Their garden is lovely as ever. The very bottom has become wild and overgrown and it was difficult to see the pond. While we played croquet J enjoyed the frogs and the chap next door showed him his terrapin. Had tea in front of the summer house. Lovely sound of solar powered water fountains and wind chimes. Big storm clouds gather overhead! Thunder + lightning on the way home + then tropical cloud burst. Humidity lifts a little. T home from DofE absolutely exhausted + rather bitten. R home from beach late - she's seen a puffin. Phone down in storm.

E's birthday and all sit on the bed for modest pressie opening. Such a busy weekend and father's day yesterday had left them all in disbelief that more celebrating was required of them today. E takes T to the dentist - has his brace off. Judy round for coffee then I dash off + shop for supper. Lovely meze style lunch before prep supper. Weaving with Deborah at the after school club - feel cheated of the opportunity to apply for a job at All Saints. Finish off tea prep. Steve + Sam, Josh + Tom round for supper. Sit in yard and enjoy good veggie fare - very nice frittata that all enjoyed - will try again. Dave arrives and after supper takes J + R to the park. Midsummers Day - finish the evening watering flowers. Yard looks lovely.
#####################

E + David get started on the final run on the kitchen. The floor, although difficult, goes down surprisingly quickly and the hob is very easy and looks very sleek. Blitz Toby's room. Busy gym runs with no M to help out. Nice supper in the yard, very hot.
#####################
22
Enjoy nice run into the market and buy fish and samphire for tea. Bump into Michelle and Roberta - have brief Italian exchange which to the untrained ear sounded more impressive than it was - Michelle thought we were very good! Lovely fish supper.

Only 4 of us for yoga - worked on the moon prayer. A lot of moves to make up a nice sequence - hard work for me.
#####################
23
Enjoy coffee + croissant at the Blakehead with Michelle. Impossible to get in the kitchen for breakfast because Colin Bell attacking kitchen hob. Kitchen very nearly finished. Looking fantastic. R has Anna + Hope to play and then very busy gym club toing and froing.
#####################
24
Saw the funniest play this evening '39 Steps' the last of our Big Night Out from L + M. Have bought E the next lot and he bought me one this evening. 4 actors played 150 parts - really clever + very funny - theatre packed. Set up my water fountain in a very nice pot from Homebase - really pleased with it - just what I wanted. Mandy arrives bearing her usual goody bag. J walks home alone and R off for sleep over. L + M back, M joins us for a cup of tea. T elbowed in face in football.
#####################
25
Relaxing breakfast of croissant and coffee before collecting R for dance festival in town. R + I speed along the river on my bike and meet up with M + D to watch Scarcroft School. Enjoy coffee + R a lemon sorbet at Capaldis before making our way home for lunch. Suit ourselves after lunch - Lily comes for rollerblading. Toast the new kitchen with bubbly + smoked salmon crostini and then sup at the Himalayan - great evening out.

Everybody slept late this morning - especially Toby. He then spent most of the day on his Geography homework, it took me ages to proof read. Dave, E and J went off to the cycle rally. Mandy, R and I sat in the yard. We fiddled about with the fountain and have finally arrived at a satisfying bubble. Cooked a roast chicken dinner + Mandy bought chocolate cake + eclairs. M + D set off for home after lunch dropping J + E back at the cycle rally. R + I cycled into Shiva to buy the tea light star holder she had her eye on. Had a little wander down the Shambles because she didn't want to go home. Finished sorting out her room - she has set up a little hidey den under the bed. J glad to be back in his room. E has found a job to apply for. Lovely warm day. Yard really looking lush in the evening darkness as I watered this evening. Nice to have kitchen back. Need to finish tidy up tomorrow.

Yorkshire Sculpture Park in bright sun and clear sky is lovely. Have never been here - it was lovely particularly the Henry Moores situated in the middle of a grassy field. Fantastic new gallery building - one side completely grass. An area dedicated to children’s workshops is tucked away in a wooded area and had a very large white rabbit - thought Rose would like this. E had to push me up the hills in the chair - very breathy today. Lovely lunch of tom. basil soup in the cafe. A lovely day out together.
#####################
28
Seemed to spend all day baking quiche for tomorrow's lunch. Spent a fair bit of inbetween time sitting in the yard listening to the fountain. E working on the YPF accounts. We had a nice sandwich lunch in the yard finishing off the smoked salmon bits. Gym club runs as per usaual + E to bed very early. J had nice time at M + L - earnt himself £2 cleaning her car.
#####################

Credit Union lunch got off to a slow start, but by the finish had actually been very successful - met a very nice woman who teaches M yoga. Chatted to St Clems treasurer + Pauline Buchanan who's very community active. E said he got the 'nutter' + had a 'God' conversation or not!! T home + pleased with his Sci + Maths Sats results - packed his bag and has set off for DofE assessed camping/walking expedition - they're having chicken again! Pains in my back + breathy - hope it's the weather.

Not very energetic today. Very difficult to get up and very breathy. One of those days where I'd have difficulty remembering what I did. Tackled the 'piles' on the back table + E sorted out the sainsbury bill. One of those boring tasks that we've been putting off, but which makes me feel clearer + lighter when it's done. Mimi arrived and we did some tie & dye. Anita brought cherries, stawberries + cream! Drove J to gym club. Watched some exciting women’s semi-final tennis.
